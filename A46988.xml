         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which I am the rather emboldned to, ſeeing that, where <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> is the Theme, an humble Recourſe for Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage ſeems owing to none leſs than a <hi>King;</hi> or Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be made to any leſs than the Beſt of <hi>Princes,</hi> to countenance a Diſcourſe of the Beſt of <hi>Governments.</hi> My want of Skill to copy all the Beauties of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Monarchy,</hi> (an Excellency no Hand can pretend to) will not, I hope, leſſen the Eſteem of the Subject.

All that a Writer can perform in a Subject of this Nature, is, to give an Hiſtorical Account of the Riſe, Progreſs, and Conſtitution of the Government; to ſhew the Admirable Order and Firmneſs of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; to collect the Real, Solid, and Certain Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits

            <head>THE Introduction.</head>
            <p>WHEN a Fire happens in any conſiderable Building (much more in a magnificent Pallace) every one runs with his Bucket, works at the Engine, helps to rear the Ladders, or do ſomething to ſtay the Ravage of the Flames; and when the devouring Element hath reduced all to Cinder, and Embers, then hath he leiſure to conſider the Proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Cauſes of it, the unhappy Accidents that produced it, and the ways and means whereby ſo waſting a Deſtruction might have been prevented. After which, he ſurveys in his Melancholy Thoughts, the former curious Arrchitecture, the rare contrivance, largeneſs, and beauty of the Rooms, and Statelineſs of the whole Pile. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome time, allowed to his affrightment and aſtoniſhment, begins to forecaſt, how a more durable Structure may be raiſed again, of leſs combuſtible, or periſhable Materials. He thinks then of facing it with <hi>Jaſper</hi> Cruſting, and flooring of it with Marble, and ſo ſecuring it, that nothing but the laſt deflagration ſhall diſſolve it.</p>
            <p>So thoſe of his Majeſties Subjects, who lived before the Calamitous Fire was kindled in his Bleſſed Father's Dominions, could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a moſt anxious Concern, reflect on the antient Glory of that ſo well-diſpoſed, and beautiful Monarchy, brought to that ſad Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe, by thoſe who at firſt, may he preſumed, deſigned no ſuch Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: but by proſperous ſucceſs, and fatal Intervening Accidents, devolved the Power into ſuch Hands, as by an implacable Malice, and incredible Barbarity were not ſatiated even with the ſacred Blood of the Bleſſed Martyr.</p>
            <p>Thoſe erected a most Tyrannical Commonwealth, and Oligarchy (Governments unknown to theſe Iſles, ſince the <hi>Roman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest) and with inexpreſſible Cruelty, and Devastation, for many Years exhausted the Blood and Treaſure of the Subjects.</p>
            <p>But when they had filled the meaſure of their Wickedneſs, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Power rolled from one Hand to another, The miraculous Restauration of His late Majesty, reſeated the Monarchy again, and ſetled us in a most profound Peace, while all the neighbouring Countries were haraſſed with cruel Hoſtilities, and moſt Bloody Wars.</p>
            <p>However though that great Prince, by the Bleſſing of God, laid the Foundation of a Glorious Temple of Concord, Peace, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of Empire; yet for ſome Years before his Death, we ſaw a ſtrange Propenſity, in Male-contents, tumultuous Petitioners, Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciators, and daring Promotors of the Bill of Secluſion, to involve the Kingdom again in a Civil War.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:66310:4"/>
            <p>Having a natural Inclination, rather to imploy the time I had to ſpare from the diligent Attendance upon my Profeſſion, in the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Antiquities, than in other Divertiſements; It was, during theſe later Revolutions, that I did more immediately employ ſome of my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Hours in reviſing not only my former Collections, out of our own, and other choice Hiſtorians, but in peruſing ſome of the Works of our ableſt Maſters in the Laws, for the eſtabliſhing my own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and digeſted ſomething ſuitable to the then State of Affairs.</p>
            <p>Which while I was eſſaying, ſome Perſons of Honour (to whom I must ever pay a ready Obedience) ſuggeſted to me, that ſome Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe diſcovering the Excellency of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy, would be uſefull to the Publique.</p>
            <p>This to me was a ſufficient Command, and from thenceforward, I began to Plot out ſomething towards it. Which from a deſign of ſome few Sheets (by the large extent of the Subject) hath ſwelled to this Volume; which the conſiderate will eaſily judg I could not well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize in a leſs Bulk, ſince almoſt every Chapter contains what might have required a ſingle Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>There being alſo ſcarce one particular Branch of the Conſtitution of the Monarchy, the black Parliament did not alter; I have been obliged under all thoſe Heads to examine their Principles, detect their Frauds, ſiniſter deſigns, and the miſchievous Conſequences of thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations or ſubverſions they made, and have treated ſo much the largelier of thoſe Peſts of all Governments, Faction, Sedition, and Rebellion, as I conceived the quiet repoſe, and tranquillity of the Government required it.</p>
            <p>Yet I flatter my ſelf, that all concerned therein, will take my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, reaſoning and collections in good part: Since I have no other deſign, but to prevent their Perſonal Rain, and the Calamities that have been ſo waſtingly brought upon theſe Kingdoms by them; and may be brought again, if ever the like ſhould be attempted.</p>
            <p>For the effectual prevention of which, I am in hopes, that the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the Constitution of the Government, will be an uſeful Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, and would wiſh all Male-contents to conſider (what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting of History, and their own Experience may teach them) that however the Engliſh Monarchy for a time, by Faction, Sedition, or Rebellion, may be weakned, or Eclipſed; yet the juſt Monarohy, like the Sun, ever diſſipates all the Mists, hazy Weather, and Clouds; and will at last (though ſometimes not without Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) clear the Air, and ſhine with more Powerfullneſs, and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor than before.</p>
            <p>The rude ſhocks of popular Disturbance, do but more ſecurely esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Throne. It being the Prudence of every Governour to make more defenſible that part of the Fortreſs, which by any Aſſault, hath been found most weak, and untenable.</p>
            <p>As I have endeavoured on the one hand to keep the Subjects in their Duty, and by all Dehortments, reclaim them from Sedition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and have laid open the ancient State of the Government, and the abſoluteneſs of our Princes, for ſome Ages after the Conqueſt: nevertheleſs I would not be underſtood to intend the reducing the
<pb facs="tcp:66310:4"/>Subject to their Priſtine Bondage. This is far from my Thoughts.</p>
            <p>What I have done in this kind, is not only becauſe the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter required the deſcribing the ancient Model of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that of late the Power of our Monarchs hath been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be too much reſtrained, but principally upon three Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to diſcover the gradual Relaxations of the abſoluteneſs of our Princes, for the greater caſe of the Subjects. Secondly, to let all know that our Liberties, Priviledges, and Immunities, have proceeded from the Grants, Benevolences, and Gracious Condeſcenſions of our Kings. Thirdly, to induce the Subjects with due thankfullneſs to acknowledg the bountiful Favour of our Soveraigns, and the Wiſdom of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, in ſolliciting for, and obtaining ſuch Liberties as we enjoy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the degree of any Subjects, either to Crowned Heads, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks. There being ſuch Barriers ſet in <hi>England,</hi> betwixt the Soveraign, and his Subjects, as neither can remove without fatal Inconvenience.</p>
            <p>For as the Princes greateſt Eaſe, Proſperity, and Glory, is when he Reigns, not ſo much over the bodies, as in the hearts of his Subjects, and rules by the Laws: So the Peoples Profit, Plenty and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, is the moſt certain and eſtabliſhed, when they are content with the Enfranchiſements the Laws allow, and endeavour not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Prerogatives of the Crown; as the Houſes of Parliament,<note place="margin">

            <p>I have endeavoured in the whole work, to diſcover how much the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy excells other ancient and modern Governments, and even the <hi>Utopia</hi> and Fictitious Ideas of the Philoſophers. The ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious <hi>Polybius</hi> hath a memorable obſervation, That every Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy is not to be called a Kingdom; but that only, which is yielded to by the willing, [that is, which is freely ſubmitted to, to diſtinguiſh it from Tyranny] and which is governed by Counſel, rather than by fear or force. Alſo that every Government of few, is not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Principality of the Optimacy: but that wherein the juſt and Prudent by Election have the Power. That, he ſaith further, is not to be called the Empire of the People, where every multitude hath Power of doing what they will or purpoſe; but where the Countries Cuſtomes flouriſh, where the Gods are worſhipped, Parents honoured, the Elder Perſons reverenced, and the Laws obeyed.</p>
            <p>All which I hope I have made apparent, are better provided for in our Hereditary Monarchy, than in any other known Government, eſpecially as to the Peoples benefit in the rare Conſtitution of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative, and yet the Soveraign hath retained ſufficient Power to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Peace of his Countries, and be able to bear the Port of a great and juſt Monarch.</p>
            <p>In this Treatiſe I meddle not with the <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> they have too much of Majeſty impreſſed upon them, to be deſcribed by ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:66310:5"/>Pencils as I can uſe; and like the Kings Coin, are incircled with a <hi>Decus &amp; Tutamen,</hi> may neither be clipped, nor adulterated.</p>
            <p>Neither have I medled with the Religious part of the Government, that not being my Province. I write abſtractedly of the Soveraign, and the Conſtitution, without regard to the Religion of the Prince: as being well ſatisfied, that whatever Qualifications the Subjects may wiſh for in their Prince; yet Religion <hi>qua</hi> Religion, ſhould neither influence the Succeſſion, nor their Obedience.</p>
            <p>In ſo great an undertaking, I hope it will be conſidered, that as in a great Building, all the Rooms are not alike richly furniſhed, There are ſome <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils fit for the Kitchin, which are not for the Dining Room: Some Pictures ſuit the Hall, others the Stair-caſe: Such as are for Chimney-pieces, are not agreeable to the Great Chamber: The choiceſt are fit for the withdrawing Room, and the enriched Cloſets.</p>
            <p>So in this work I am obliged to keep a <hi>decorum.</hi> In ſome places I have reaſon to uſe a more cloſe and contracted, in others a more free and looſe way of Arguing. Sometimes I am forced to uſe the ſignificant, though obſolete, Saxon, or the crabbed Terms of Law, and Arts, and intermix the leſs refined Sentences of old Authors, according as the ſubject matter required; ſo that I could no waies uſe that politeneſs of phraſe, or roundneſs of Period<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the curious may expect.</p>
            <p>I preſume not, that every one will be equally delighted with the reſearches I have made into the uſages of remote Ages: or with the Cenſures upon ſome mens later Actions. But moſt, I hope, will find good uſe of either; and when they conſider I have endeavored to follow great Authors, and have faithfully quoted them, they will more readily acquit me.</p>
            <p>Therefore I beg that the Ingenious Peruſer will not paſs his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon parcels; but after he hath peruſed the whole, will be ſo cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to believe, that thoſe Parts, which are leſs acceptable to him, may be grateful to others; and will allow, that in ſo great a work (wherein much variety of Reading and Argument was requiſite) I cannot expect to adapt things to the Genius of every one.</p>

            <p>What Apologie <hi>Lipſius</hi> makes for himſelf, I muſt crave the benefit of; That though I have culled out from Learned Authors great variety of Sentences, yet I have not ſo ſcatteringly ſtrowed them, that they might ſeem Sand without Lime; but have with ſuch Cement as I could, not undecently inlaid them. And as the workers of Hangings, from threads of divers colours weave one piece of Tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: So from a thouſand Arguments, and materials I have faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the uniform and connected diſcourſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy:
<pb facs="tcp:66310:5"/>which though in ſingle branches, hath with great Judgment and Arts been compoſed by others; yet, that I know of, hath not been ſo digeſted in one body before.</p>
            <p>This conſideration leads me to another neceſſary Apology for my ſelf; that whereas (by an heedleſneſs I dare not excuſe) I had not in my firſt draught, noted the Pages in ſome Modern Authors, nor the Authors themſelves, yet have tranſcribed their whole Sentences. I deſire the candid Authors, and Reader, not to Interpret this a ſtudied Plagiariſm; but rather impute it to the good Opinion I had, of the vivacity and ſignificancy of their expreſſions, which made me inſert them, and no deſign to vend ſtollen Wares undiſcovered; for it will be eaſily found, that I challenge them not as my own: and if the attentive collate ſuch places, he will find, that what ever rich Gemms or Metals I have borrowed, I have endeavoured to place them with advantage: and though I cannot ſay, I have enriched them in the ſetting; yet have moſtly uſed ſome workmanſhip about them, or have added ſome ancient Authority parallel to them.</p>
            <p>This having been the product of many ſpare Hours, and my Profeſſion (which no other ſtudies have ever interfered with) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving often obliged me, to leave the matter abruptly, in the middle of a Paragraph; whereby I returned not again to it, with the ſame warmth and train of thoughts; and the ſending up my Copy in parcels, at diſtant times, to the Preſs, I hope will prevail with the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to pardon what inconnexion, broken ends, or ſome ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition may be found in it.</p>
            <p>I muſt here alſo advertiſe the Reader that the whole Original was writ, and the moſt part Printed, before the laſt Seſſion of Parliament <hi>Nov.</hi> the 9th. So that what hath fallen out ſince, he can expect no touches upon: and though at preſent the Harmony be not the ſame that was formerly betwixt the King and his two Houſes; yet it is to be hoped that, betwixt ſo Wiſe and Gracious a King, and ſo Loyal a Parliament, there can be no long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, eſpecially when it is conſidered who will have the greateſt advantage by it.</p>
            <p>If this Treatiſe contribute any thing to it, I ſhall think my ſelf very happy. However I hope, Gentlemen and Scholars will find it a pleaſing divertiſement in their Cloſets and Studies; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fitted for the hours of ſuch receſs, and upon every head (there being variety of matter collected, and great Volumes epitomized, and ſeveral Authors noted who treat upon that Subject) it will be a Promptuary or Common-place, out of which many, out of this Ore, upon occaſions of moment, may digeſt for their own uſe refineder notions, and having a competent ſtore of Obſervations, from Writers of good esteem, laid before them, may with more eaſe bring them to the Teſt of their own Judgments.</p>
            <p>Having dealt thus frankly with all, I hope, Gentlemen will allow me that plea, which moſt require, that for ſome Moles, Dimples or Scars, an otherwiſe tolerable mien is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned: and though I must expect the fate of all Builders, that moſt will conclude they could have contrived better;<note place="margin">In magnis veluſe yat eſt.</note> yet I hope three things: First, That the well-wiſhers to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy will

Secondly, That this may excite ſome, who have more leiſure, greater helps, and more refined Judgments, to undertake this uſeful ſubject, with happier <hi>Auſpices.</hi> And laſtly, That none will entertain a worſe opinion of the Government by reaſon of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful deſcribing of it, or deſpiſe the whole, becauſe I may (for all my Circumſpection) have committed Errors in following the Sentiments of ſome.

                  <hi>Philoſopher</hi> obſerves, That by the turbulence of depraved Appetites, by heady Raſhneſs, and ſeducing Paſſions in the vitious and ill-affected, the Body ſeems to command the Soul, and Reaſon is dethron'd: So in the Commonweal, when from miſtakes and miſguided Zeal, Diſcontent, Ambition, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vitious Inclinations, People are infected, whereby the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Fever of Sedition, or the Peſt of Rebellion rageth in a State; the Sovereign is, for a time, kept from the Exerciſe of his Royal Power,<note place="margin">The Scheme of the whole work.</note> and ſometimes dethron'd.</p>
               <p>But to leave this pleaſing Allegory, which I could purſue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring all the Members of the Body, and Faculties of the Soul with the conſtituent Parts and Offices of <hi>Government:</hi> I ſhall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that, draw a ſhort Scheme of my deſign in this Work, which I had never undertaken, if it had not been that I was invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it by a Great and Wiſe Miniſter of State,<note place="margin">My Lord Preſident.</note> whoſe glorious Service to his Prince and Country will be celebrated in remoteſt Ages: and having liv'd to make ſome Obſervations on the Cauſes and Managery of the Rebellion againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, and the tendency to another Civil War of later date; and revolving with my ſelf, that though many wiſe and judicious Perſons both know, and have learnedly writ, of the ſecret Springs and Movements of them, infinitely beyond what I can pretend to: and that both our own Country-men have, in Parts, writ of all the branches of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and many Foreigners of Politics in general, or ſuch as were fitted for the Governments under which they lived; yet having met with none that had ſo particularly writ of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy, as to illuſtrate it ſo as it might be uſeful to the preventing Seditions and Rebellions, and to clear the Commodiouſneſs and Neceſſity of ſubmitting to it; and placing a great Portion of our happineſs here in living under it, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it might be a profitable Eſſay to excite thoſe, who have not leiſure and opportunity to peruſe great and numerous Volumes, to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66310:7"/>extract, for their uſe, ſuch things as had occurred in my poor Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to induce them to prize it as they ought, and to furniſh them with ſuch Arguments, as my low Reaſoning was able, whereby to anſwer the Objections of our late Republicans againſt it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Methods of Proceedings towards the overthrowing it, and to caution all the well-meaning Subjects againſt all the Arts of Factious and Seditious People and Principles.</p>
               <p>And though I cannot promiſe my ſelf the ſucceſs I wiſh; yet I hope I may excite ſome more knowing, learned and judicious, to furniſh our little World with a more Copious and Elaborate Piece, which may ſupply my defects, and more abundantly ſatisfy the ingenious and curious Reader, to whom I ſhall now draw the Curtain, and expoſe the Model of the deſigned Work.</p>

               <p>BEfore I proceed to treat of the ſeveral forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I judge it requiſite to examine ſome poſitions made uſe of by Republicans; ſo long at leaſt, as they argue againſt Monarchical Government, or till they obtain their ends in the ſubverting of it.</p>
               <p>One of which is, that ſupreme power is originally and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally in the People, for whoſe benefit all Government was eſtabliſhed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there is a tacit reſervation of power in them, to vary the form of Government, and change the Perſons when the people finds it convenient for them. The Law of Nature, as they ſay, juſtifying any attempt to ſhake off thoſe Bonds and Fetters impoſed on them by their Superiors, or voluntarily yielded to by themſelves, if they judge that thereby their common Freedom is impeached; for that, they ſay, the People never ſubmitted to any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by way of Agreement and Contract, unleſs in caſes of abſolute Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore one (whom the Commonwealth-men eſteem their<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Algernon Sydney.</note> Martyr) aſſerted, That Kings have Uſurped over the People a power inconſiſtent with their natural liberty, and that Kings owe their right to preſcription, which the greateſt Tyrant may maintain by force, and to that conſent which they may procure by violence or flattery.</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible, that I might more orderly have placed what I have to anſwer to theſe aſſertions, in the Chapter of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; but intending to prove that to be the beſt of all the known Governments, and that Chapter and the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding it, being ſo large, I judge it not ſo fit to clog it with this, but make it as a preliminary. For though I oppoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy principally to this ſentiment; yet it hath ſomething in it alſo of uſe, to the right ſtating of the Original of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore I ſhall endeavour to evince, That God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty was the Original Donor of the Authoritative Power
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66310:12"/>of Government,<note place="margin">The Power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from God to One, and not to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; there neither was nor is Natural Freedom.</note> and that not to any collective body of the People; <hi>Secondly,</hi> that there never was ſuch a ſtate of primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive freedom, or natural liberty, as is challenged; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That where ever the Peoples Election was admitted in conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting a Soveraign, they capitulated not for any reſervery of power of reſumption; and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that in the preſent State of our Engliſh Monarchy, no ſuch Power ought to be challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>Firſt then (with a Reverend<note n="(b)" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Addreſs to the Lord <hi>Fairfax, p.</hi> 8, 9.

               <p>But ſince from the Fall it is apparent, that the irregular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Men, have cauſed a need both of Rules and Rulers, Laws and Law-makers: it was but reaſonable that God ſhould, and it is moſt certain that he did deſign and appoint Government; and ſo gave not man that freedom which is ſuppoſed to be the foundation of this Doctrine. Hence we may note what God ſays to <hi>Eve,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16.</note> That her deſire ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to her Husband, and he ſhall rule over her: ſo that here is the firſt Dominion. And the ſecond we find in Scripture, is,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>We have reaſon to judge, (according to Scripture) that God gave <hi>Adam</hi> (as an univerſal Monarch) Dominion over all his Fellow Creatures, and of all Men that ſhould be born into the World as long as he liv'd, and the like may be ſaid of <hi>Noah:</hi> ſo that whatever property (as it is clear <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> had) and what ſhare of Government over any part of the World, either of their Sons had, they held it all of them originally by gift and Aſſignment, Allotment and Authority, without awaiting the Election or conſent of, or entring into any Articles or Capitulations with the People that were to be governed by them.</p>
               <p>So that in the Infancy of the World all Men were born Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, either to him that was naturally their Father, or to him that by Right of <hi>Primogeniture</hi> was repreſentatively their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>So upon the overthrow and breaking up of Kingdoms, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance may be given that ſome victorious Perſon obtain'd the Peoples Subjection to him; for that being depriv'd of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural common Father, and Sovereign, they neceſſarily entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch ſupply of their loſs, as their Fortunes could beſt afford them: and whatever thoſe conquered People did, it was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the chuſing of one to bear the known Office of the true natural common Father; even as thoſe might do, who either like Swarms and Colonies, voluntarily ſeparated from the main Stock, to more roomy and rich Plantations; or thoſe who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped from the Conquerors Sword into a remote unpeopled Land, ſetled themſelves in Society, and under the Government of one. For as hereafter I ſhall make it appear, the world was grown to a great Age, e're any form of Government was known but what was Kingly.

               <p>Having thus far Illuſtrated the Government in the Golden Age of the World, wherein we find no Footſteps, or the leaſt tract of any popular Suffrages, but an entailing of Sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; We may farther conſider,<note place="margin">God appointed Kings.</note> that the Government of the ſeveral Kingdoms in this World have been, and are by the appointment of the Sovereign of the whole World, not only by Gods appointment of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the ſeveral Judges, and Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> but by the frequent expreſſions in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

               <p>Whence alſo are they ſtiled Gods, but to denote they were not made by Men?

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66310:14"/>them; but as repreſenting God himſelf. For every ſupream Magiſtrate hath a Power that never was in the People to give; for never any Man was by God or Nature inveſted with Power of his own Life to take it away, or kill himſelf lawfully. For all Chriſtians generally declare againſt this Self-murther, as a Crime equally againſt the ſixth Commandment, as the killing of any other Man.</p>
               <p>Now this Power of Life being ſo eſſential a part of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and no part of the natural Liberty, cannot be inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent naturally in a Community of Men, which have no more Power ſo united, than each ſingle Perſon hath. So that though it cannot be ſaid with ſome, <hi>Nemo eſt dominus Membrorum ſuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> (for Man hath the power over his Members, to cauſe one to be cut off, for the preſerving the whole; and the <hi>Jew</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods own Government, had power to make himſelf a Slave) yet this <hi>Jus Gladii,</hi> the Right and Power of the Sword (which is really the Sovereign Power) is by the<note n="(m)" place="margin">

For it was not in the Power of the People to diſpenſe with Gods Precept, Thou ſhalt not kill, nor to diſtinguiſh ſhedding of Blood with the Sword of Vengeance, from Murther; and conſequently the Power is not deriv'd to Kings and Princes by private Men, who cannot transfer that Power they never had; according to that known Maxim, <hi>Nemo plus juris transferre ad alium poteſt, quam ipſe habet:</hi> but it's beſtowed on them by God Almighty, who is the ſole Arbiter of Life and Death, who can only take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, becauſe he gave it.</p>
               <p>The ſupream Magiſtrate therefore, as God's Deputy, hath the Power communicated to him, as an Endowment neceſſary to that Power which is deſign'd to protect and govern others.

               <p>When Kings are Elective, though it be the act of the People, and not of God immediately that deſigns or nominates the Perſon to that Office; yet doth not this Nomination beſtow this Power; but God who alone hath this Power, beſtows it on him who is ſo Elected.

So that according to his opinion, and the experience of all ages, the People may be truly ſaid to be the Original of Tyrants, and not of Kings.

               <p>Thoſe who pleaſe themſelves with the notion of Compact and Agreement, moſtly do it for ſome ill end, to make a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Scheme, to decoy the People into an opinion, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces can claim no more Power as of right belonging to them, than the People ſhall intruſt them withal; which they may from time to time (as they ſhall ſee cauſe in order to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended publick weal and ſafety) either enlarge or reſtrain at their pleaſure.</p>

Was the Wives intereſt towards making up the bargain equal with that of the Husband, and the Child with that of the Parents? and the Servant's (if there were, or could be any ſuch thing as Maſter and Servant) equal with that of his Maſter's? If one had not an equal ſhare and intereſt in the buſineſs, whence did the inequality ariſe? who made the difference among them? and what right had any man? and how came he to have that right to give more or leſs pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to one than another?</p>
               <p>If all were equal, who could ſummon the reſt to convene, or appoint the day and place of meeting?

               <p>None of theſe look like the Dictates of the Laws of Nature, and other Laws beſides that (according to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi>) could be none, when as yet there was no Government, and the Contract it ſelf as a bare contract (without the help of ſome Law or other to give it force) cannot operate upon any but the Contractors; for it can have no cogency upon thoſe that never gave conſent thereto.</p>

               <p>To gratifie the inſatiable Republican as much as may be, let us ſuppoſe a Colony, or ſwarm of younger Brothers, men that lived poorly in their native Country, Women, Children and Servants, not tied by any preceding Allegiance to a Prince, or to have ſhaken off the yoke, or to be baniſhed, or freely diſmiſſed by thoſe under whoſe Government they had been born, and to be abſolved from all Allegiance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared manumitted and reſtored to that abſolute freedom, which they could claim as the birth-right of mankind, that priviledge of nature equally common to every one as the air and light, and to enjoy this freedom as an unlimited power, to uſe their abilities as will did prompt; and thoſe to paſs into an unpeopled Land, which no Prince or People laid a claim to: Would not every one conclude theſe were as free to live as they liſted, as any people under the Sun; and to be any ways reſtrained of this, would be very grievous, and an Invaſion of that right to freedom every one might challenge?</p>
               <p>Yet can it be conceived, that theſe could continue long without the conſideration, that it was not ſo delightful to do what every one liked, as it would be miſerable to ſuffer as much as it pleaſed others to inflict; or that the powerful could take comfort in that hoſtile eſtate, wherein he was in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fears of others miſchievous deſigns againſt him, who had in this imagined ſtate<note n="(x)" place="margin">

               <p>The conſideration of this ſurely would oblige every one to transfer his particular power into one or more hands, tying themſelves by obligation, not to make uſe of that natural power of reſiſting the power ſet over them, but to aid him or them, when he or they ſummoned their ſtrength, or required their aſſiſtance. In requital of which ſubmiſſion of private ſtrength, the whole Government becomes their Guard, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are ſecured from the dangers of private injuries.</p>
               <p>But can it be thought that any ſuch Governour or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours would take upon him or them, the burthen of ſpending
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66310:17"/>his whole time in watchfulneſs, anxiety and care, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſuch a ſociety in peace, and the free enjoyments of what they ſhould acquire, without having a power to execute impartial Juſtice upon Offenders, in raiſing forces to ſuppreſs any Tumults or Inſurrections, in rewarding and promoting the inferior Miniſters; or would yield himſelf to be accountable to any party of that people who ſhould fancy themſelves ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, to make the Government uſeful, it muſt be eſtabliſhed, that every one yield his life to Soveraign Juſtice, to be capitally puniſhed, if he tranſgreſs ſuch Laws as they had agreed upon to be ſo inflicted, or in leſſer offences to yield to proportionable puniſhments.</p>
               <p>Now if it were to be underſtood as a tacit Covenant, that when ever the Subjects found themſelves aggrieved, they might re-aſſume their Power, and depoſe or change their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign; every Offender that could engage his Relations or Dependents to back him, would be remonſtrating, and to avoid the puniſhment (eſpecially if Capital) would adventure his life in Arms, and ſo defeat the great end and deſign of Government.</p>
               <p>But further, ſuppoſing that this People oblige themſelves and Poſterities, by Oaths and other Authentic Bonds, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Government againſt all Diſturbers, Domeſtick and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; and to be ſubject, and pay all due obedience to the Government and Laws: By what juſtice, or reaſon, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of natural Right, could they or their Poſterity claim a power of re-aſſumption of that Original Power they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted themſelves of?</p>
               <p>It is manifeſt that a People may conſent to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a Soveraign without limitation, as appears by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous<note n="(y)" place="margin">Inſtitut. de Jure naturali Gent. &amp; Civ. <hi>56.</hi>

After which the right of Nature, which remains for them innocently to make uſe of, is that freedom, not which any Law gives, but which no Law takes away.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if we conſider Men once to have been in ſuch an imaginary State of freedom, and after to have yielded up themſelves to be ſubject, and thereto tyed themſelves and their Poſterities, in the ſtrongeſt obligations that can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; What power can ſuch People now have of ſubſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their obedience, ſince their Anceſtors, many Centuries of Ages ſince, and in all ſucceſſive Generations, have either transferred what Power they ever could claim, to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, or by his Laws and their own conſents have bound themſelves in fidelity to the Soveraign, his Heirs and lawful Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>So that in what <hi>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66310:18"/>of Power being in the People, and their Power of re-aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, may be aſſerted; it can have no place in our happy Iſlands. For the Government of <hi>England</hi> is a ſucceſſive He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Monarchy, declared ſo by all our Laws: ſo that with us, allegations of natural Right have no ſort of place, our Kings having their Power eſtabliſhed by Birth-right, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, by Preſcription and Law, which are all the ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any right can be legally eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Therefore we muſt look upon all ſuch as caſt in ſuch Baits for the People to nibble at, that they intend to make a prey of them; and having faſtned the gilded Hook in their Jaws, may draw them out of their own Element to a free air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but ſuch as will ſtifle them. For when any Subjects (by the inſtigation of ſuch pretended Patriots) are excited to put in their claim of Original Power, and ſhake the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though their Rebellion be proſperous, it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vaſt effuſion of Blood that the Government can be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. After which, how will it be poſſible that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the People can be put into that priſtin ſtate of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, thoſe State-Mountebanks promiſe? but rather into an Anarchy, which is contrary to the end of all Society, and to quiet and peace, and is the Parent of all confuſion, which is much worſe than the hardeſt ſubjection.</p>
               <p>This truth (by a moſt chargeable tryal) we experimented in the late War, when the Pretended Saviours of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and great Promoters of Spiritual and Temporal Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, having wheedled the People into a belief of their honeſt Intentions, and by their proſperous Arms overthrown the moſt temperate Monarchy, by the effuſion of infinite Blood and Treaſure; by pretended agreements of the People, they aſſumed the Government to themſelves; enſlaving both the Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty, more than any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Conqueror would do, or ever their Anceſtors had been in any Age; and the Golden Scepter, and that of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> with the Dove, was turned into a Rod of Iron and a Flaming Sword, Baſilisks and Fiery Serpents.</p>

For, granting this moſt enormous Doctrine, and dangerous Principle; Laws being alterable for the Convenience of Prince or People, by conſequence the Right of the Sovereign (if it be onely from the Laws) muſt be preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious alſo.</p>
               <p>The Opinion is in it ſelf moſt abſurd and unreaſonable; for there never could be Laws, till there was ſome Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to eſtabliſh and enact ſuch Laws, and give them their energy and vigour: For nothing can have the force or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Law, or oblige men to Obedience, unleſs it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſuch Perſon or Perſons as have a Right to command, and Authority to puniſh the Diſobedience and Neglect of thoſe who ought to be ſubject to it: So that it is almoſt impoſſible to find the leaſt Footſteps of Law, that is by far ſo ancient as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the Infancy of the World, when Nations were divided by the Swarms that made new Colonies; we may eaſily conceive, that Differences and Quarrels would not onely fall out amongſt them about Boundaries; but within the Diſtrict of one Government, the Shares of diſtinct Families and Perſons would be allotted, and theſe would require the Preſervation of thoſe Peculiars, from the Incroachment of Thieves, Robbers, or other miſchievous Perſons: From whence muſt ſpring a neceſſity of Laws, to prevent Domeſtick Quarrels and Injuries, and to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to every man his Right, and effect thoſe good things which would make the Society happy.</p>

                  <hi>Seneca</hi> elegantly calls the Laws, <hi>Virtutes Armatas,</hi> becauſe they compel evil manners into good order: for without Laws Men are but a more cunning and pernicious ſort of Brutes; and where they are inſtituted and prevail, humane Nature is moſt civilized, refin'd and polite.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of the Liberal Arts, that <hi>Emolliunt mores, nec ſinunt eſſe feros:</hi> They ſoften Mens minds and manners, they correct that churliſhneſs of temper, and addulce and mellow the auſtere, ſowre and crabbed Diſpoſition, tame and make gentle the Savage Natures, file off the Aſperities of them: all which is equally true of the force and efficacy of the Laws put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>

               <p>As to Community of Goods, the Argument that <hi>Socrates</hi> uſed was, That if every one might call every thing his own, and not his own, it would be a means whereby a City would be perfectly one.</p>

For he that took pains would never agree that he who took no pains ſhould have an equal ſhare; and in a little time, one would be coveting a larger dividend than another, and this would deſtroy the great vertue of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and would allow it no place: for that conſiſts in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from what is anothers.

So he concludes, That poſſeſſing in common gives more occaſions to differences, than where every one knows his own. Therefore it is more conducible to the well-being of a People to unite in one order of Diſcipline, than in unity of Stock and Community of Goods.</p>
               <p>There was ſome difference in the <hi>modus</hi> of this communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

All being now ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of any breach made upon their Property, that Princes are looked upon as Tyrannical and Arbitrary, that ſhall, for the neceſſary ſupport of the Government, lay any impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the People, without their conſents; which made, in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's time, that outcry againſt Ship-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; though the Legality of it was owned by twelve Judges, and very ancient Records were produced, and much learning and reading ſhown in the arguments for it. But this point is now adjuſted to the ſatisfaction of the whole.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh Subject enjoys many choice peculiar Privileges and advantages,<note place="margin">The Privileges of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects in their Property.</note> far tranſcending thoſe of the Subjects of moſt Princes: So that any rougher touch upon that tender part, muſt needs gall, and the lighteſt Yoak be uneaſie to the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66310:21"/>neck unaccuſtomed to it. By his Birth-right he hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he can call his own; he hath not only the protection of his Perſon, but the inheritance of his Freehold, his Liberty and Property ſecured to him by Law; he cannot be violently aſſaulted in the one, or forceably invaded in the other, but the publick Juſtice of the Kingdom will be ſatisfied for it, and call the Aggreſſors to a ſtrict account.</p>
               <p>We have ſuch a grand Charter of all juſt and reaſonable Priviledges and Immunities, continued and confirmed to us, by the Piety, Munificence and Royal bounty of our Princes, that we may diſpute peaceable and happy living with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subjects of the World.</p>
               <p>The Government we live under, being ſetled and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by known and excellent Laws, ſuch as for their policy and prudence, juſtice and equity in their compoſition, challenge all the conſtitutions of <hi>Europe</hi> (in which part of the World are (if any where) to be found the greateſt perfections of Human Nature) to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the like.

               <p>To diſturb this bleſſed condition of the Engliſh Subject, there are two Extremes: The one of a People fond of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the Primitive fundamental of Government in the People, that they will needs have Property in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before Government; without conſidering that nothing is gained to their advantage by the conceſſion of it. For it muſt alſo be<note n="(f)" place="margin">Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>'s Preface to Power of Princes.</note> proved, that it was before it in order of time; for as one of the principal ends of Government is the preſervation of mens acquiſitions, of Cattle and Fields, by their induſtry; ſo we muſt ſuppoſe ſome Government firſt, becauſe the right which any man hath to the acquired ſtock and lands, muſt be aſcertain'd to him by ſome Law, which ſuppoſeth Government. So that the diſpute (ſaith the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Biſhop) is <hi>de Lana Caprina,</hi> and when men have crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves into the Circle, they reap nothing but a Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick giddineſs; and it is like the diſpute in <hi>Macrobius,</hi> Whether the Hen or Egg were firſt.</p>
               <p>All that believe the Creation, muſt own, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was before any Mans property, and the like may be ſaid of <hi>Noah;</hi> ſo that there is no need to have recourſe to Articles, or capitulations with the People (which thoſe make ſuch a noiſe with) unleſs they can firſt evince the World to be Eternal, and Men to have ſprung in ſome rank Soil, as <hi>Tube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra terrae,</hi> Muſhroms after a fruitful ſhower.</p>
               <p>Another Extreme is what Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> every where in his <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Againſt Arbitrary Sovereignty.</note> endeavours to eſtabliſh, <hi>(viz)</hi> That the Sovereign ſhould be ſo abſolute and ſo arbitrary, that he ſhould upon Exigents of State, or at his own pleaſure, have the diſpoſal
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66310:22"/>of every Subjects fortune, which how neceſſary it may be for vaſt Empires (ſuch as the <hi>Ottomans</hi>) I diſpute not. But the Soveraigns of Chriſtendom, eſpecially of <hi>England,</hi> take no ſuch meaſures to the advantages of themſelves, or their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſlavery.</p>
               <p>The moſt judicious Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> in his eleborate Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe againſt<note n="(g)" place="margin">Survey of <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, p.</hi> 110.</note> Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> hath with great judgment refuted this opinion, from whoſe Armory I ſhall borrow ſome of the Artillery, though I dare not preſume to uſe them with the ſame dexterity, and addreſs his Lordſhip doth.</p>
               <p>This Propriety (ſaith he) introduceth the beauty of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the cultivating of the Earth, by art as well as indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, that they and their Children might dwell in the Houſes they were at the charge to build, and reap the Harveſt of thoſe lands they had been at the charge to ſow: whatſoever is of civility and good manners, all that is of art and beauty, of rule and ſolid wealth in the world, is the product of this; the Child of beloved property; and they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Nothing but joy in propriety redeemed us from this barbarity, and nothing but ſecurity in the ſame can preſerve us from returning to it again.</p>
               <p>If there be no Propriety (continueth the great Lord) there is nothing worth defending from foreign Enemies, or from one another, and conſequently it is no matter what becomes of the Commonwealth. For the Government can never be ſo vigorouſly aſſiſted by a People who have nothing to loſe, as by thoſe who defending it, defend their own Goods and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; which if they do not believe their own, they will not much care into whoſe hands they fall.</p>

               <p>For it muſt be owned, that the primary end of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is for the better ordering the People, whereby they may live in accord among themſelves, and follow their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral imployments under the protection of the Soveraign.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66310:23"/>Therefore whoever endeavour to disjoynt and diſcompoſe the frame of Government (by the wiſdom of our Anceſtors and long experience, found ſo agreeable to the Engliſh <hi>Genius</hi>) are to be reputed, either ignorant of their own happineſs, or deſigners of as horrid miſchiefs: Whether they be ſuch, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s Principles, may leſſen the affection and tenderneſs of Princes to their Subjects, or leſſen the duty and obedience of Subjects to their Prince, and make them leſs love the conſtitution of Government they live under; or they be ſuch as would cramp the Sovereign Power, and wrap it in ſoft Ermines and Robes of State, without a Sword or Scepter.</p>
               <p>Having thus far treated of Government in general, and of the uſefulneſs of it to mankind: I think it neceſſary to give an account of the ſeveral Governments which have been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to uſed in the World; and that I may give a more diſtinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, I have choſen to repreſent them as I find they have been practiſed in the ancienteſt times: and finding ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the laſt age and this ſo zealous for a Commonwealth-Government, and ſome yet bewitched with the notions of it, I think it incumbent on me, to be more copious in the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting of the inconveniences of all other Governments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Monarchy, tht as far as my reading may afford me helps, I may diſabuſe his Majeſtie's Subjects, and repreſent to them the excellency and beauty of the Engliſh Monarchy, which is the whole ſcope and intendment of this diſcourſe; and I muſt beg pardon, if either in the words of my Authors (whom I ſhall endeavour faithfully to quote) or in my own, I uſe any ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſharper expreſſions than they are willing to hear. For I think it much more advantageous to the perſons concerned, that they feel the acrimony of my Ink, and the ſmall punctures of my Pen, than that following ſuch miſchievous Principles of our late Republicans, they ſhould have their bloods tainted, or ſuffer the edge of thoſe ſevere Laws, which are ſteeled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Rebels, and think it ſafer for them to be blackned by my Ink, than that their blood ſhould ſtain the Scaffolds.</p>

               <p>I ſhall begin with democracy; which is the Clay and Iron Feet of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image. It is but one remove from Anarchy, wherein all the People have, or pretend to have equal right to Authority, where all govern and all obey. For the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (ſaith the Philoſopher) is a Monarch or ſimple Government by aggregation of many, being many Lords, not as ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but as Members of the All; which he thus expreſſeth,<note n="(g)" place="margin">Polit. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>

A fourth where only the Inhabitants of the City, not thoſe that live diſperſed in the Villages depending on the City, had ſhare in Government, the Law alſo being the Rule. The fifth when the Multitude rule by majority of Voices, and not the Law; ſo that their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Votes were Law.</p>
               <p>We have reſemblance of theſe kinds of Governments in our Corporations,<note place="margin">Concerning the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracies in Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</note> where in the Elections of Magiſtrates, in ſome places all Freemen, in others thoſe only who have Burgage Land, in others a Common-Council ſolely, have Vote, and the whole Body, or ſuch and ſuch parts have Power to make By-laws.</p>
               <p>If we had no other Argument againſt Democracy but this, that it is of that narrow capacity that it cannot be adapted to order Regions of large extent, it would be ſufficient to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit it; for we find in thoſe incorporated little Democracies, there are more Factions and diviſions than in the whole large adjoining tracts of Land about them, though the Villages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a much numerouſer People.</p>
               <p>It is rarely found but that in all Votes relating to the public, Combinations are made by Kindreds, Companies, or Factions.

               <p>From all which, we may conclude, That Democracy in its Conſtitution is onely fitted for ſmall Principalities; and in it neither Induſtry, or worthy Perſons, can have Encouragement: How obnoxious it is to Factions, or muſt have a mixture of other Governments to ſupport it, in being headed by ſome few popular Perſons; or muſt have a ſhadow of Monarchy, in the ruling <hi>Demagogues, Ephori,</hi> or <hi>Tribunes;</hi> otherwiſe it cannot ſubſiſt.</p>

But he likewiſe obſerves, That thoſe that lived upon Tillage and Paſture (being the ancienteſt ſort

               <p>There are three things which render Democracy moſt taking with the Vulgar.<note place="margin">The plauſible Pleas for Democracy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Pretended impartial Adminiſtration of Juſtice. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſpecious, but empty Name of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſo much applauded Equality, by which they ſeem to reduce their Civil Conſtitutions to the primary Laws of Nature, which gave to all men Common Right.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, (ſaith a Judicious<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dudley Digs</hi> of Reſiſtance <hi>p.</hi> 22. 1. That Juſtice is not ſo impartially adminiſtred.</note> Author, whoſe Diſcourſe on this Head I ſhall epitomize) Their Hopes that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhould be more equally adminiſtred, are grounded upon this, That though ſome Rivers may be corrupted, yet the Ocean cannot. A man may ſatisfie the Intereſts of ſome few, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them into favour and reſpect of Perſons; but it is hard to do the ſame with a Multitude: for to buy Juſtice of ſo many, would be no thriving Trade.</p>
               <p>But this, though plauſible, is but a very fallacious Argument: For it is found by experience, that ſome few more crafty Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who have gained Credit with the People, order Buſineſs in their cloſe Committees, and ſo undiſcernably lead the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to whatever they call the Publick Good (of which they, having prevailed upon their Affections, are eſteemed the moſt competent Judges) by which any one of the Juncto (for they muſt gratifie each other mutually) is enabled to croſs the Courſe of Law in a Friend's behalf, and to put a ſharper Edge upon the Sword of Juſtice when it ſtrikes an Enemy.</p>
               <p>Theſe kind of men, by frothy Eloquence in ſet Speeches, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly fitted to the Capacity of the Common People, having got the Art of changing the Peoples Opinion of Juſt and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, (for Reaſons are not weighed, where ſuch Numbers hold the Ballance) their Art is to apply their Harangues to that which rules the weaker men, the Affections; and theſe are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily convinced, and made the Meaſures of their Judgments, the want of weight in the<note n="(d)" place="margin">Suaden'o docent, non docendo ſuadent.</note> Premiſſes being ſupplied by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary love to the Concluſion.</p>
               <p>The Judgments of Right and Wrong (being not like Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Knowledge) are as various as their Intereſts different, becauſe they concern <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> wherein Profit is the<note n="(e)" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> as to Liberty;<note place="margin">2. True Liberty is wanting in Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy.</note> it is ſtrange Men ſhould ſo generally fall in love with a bare ſound, and court a name of freedom, which duly examined, ſignifies nothing. They cannot mean by it a looſeneſs from all Laws; they dare not own ſuch perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Licence; the true debate is not, Whether they ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Bonds of Laws (for they readily embrace them, being forged and fitted by themſelves) but who ſhall impoſe them? The queſtion is not, Whether<note n="(f)" place="margin">Non an ſervirent, ſed an ſervirent uni vel pluribus.</note> they ſhould ſerve, but, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould ſerve one or more? and with them it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Liberty, to ſerve many Maſters.</p>
               <p>Now if we rightly conſider, the reſtraint of our Freedom is that which is moſt valuable amongſt the benefits of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For this it is preſerves Peace among men, by it their hands are tied up from doing injury. Every one, it is true, could wiſh to retain full and abſolute liberty, but not upon condition all others ſhould enjoy the ſame. For that love to it, and delight in it, is overbalanced by the fears, and the ſad conſideration ariſing from the thoughts of others freedom, to make us ſuffer as much as they may be tempted to inflict.</p>
               <p>Beſides, where can true Liberty be, where the unconſtant <hi>Mobile</hi> have the diſpenſing of it; who have no clear <hi>Idea</hi> of it, are always catching at the ſhadow, and the ungraſped Cloud, for <hi>Juno.</hi> Their Votes are eaſily corrupted, when a<note n="(g)" place="margin">Platarc. in Vita Marii.</note> 
                  <hi>Marius</hi> pours out Buſhels of Corn in the <hi>Forum,</hi> to buy them: They are impelled as we ſee in crowds, firſt one way, then another, ebbing and flowing in their actions, like the unconſtant Ocean; and this they call their Liberty, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is their ſervile Bondage, being all this while in the ſhorter or longer Chain of their corrupt affections or weak judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For how can we think the common body competent Judges to manage affairs, who beſides inconſtancy and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, do every thing in ſuch a manner as it is very hard to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Tumults and Multitudes; and amongſt Judges, ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified as they are, it is not enough to give prudent Council, but it muſt likewiſe be fortunate; otherwiſe the judicious gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of it, may probably find a great abridgment of his Liberty, if not worſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Concerning Equality,<note place="margin">Concerning Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> while they urge it comes nearer to the Law of Nature; by the ſame reaſon they muſt diſſolve Government, ſince it would take away all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Superiors and Inferiors. Beſides, it is againſt Nature it ſelf, that there ſhould be ſuch Equality; as to inſtance, if in Rewards it had been intended, Nature would have made all men equally deſerving: and Reaſon teacheth us, that ſince we may excel others by Education and Induſtry; greater Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements ſhould be allotted in conſideration of the charges of good breeding, and of the extraordinary ſtudies whereby
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66310:27"/>Men enable themſelves to ſerve the Publick. Beſides, this Equality, though pretended to conſerve, doth in truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Unity; for none are ſo quarrelſome, none ſo ſubject to envy as equals: Every one being Judge in his own caſe, will yield nothing to common Juſtice.</p>
               <p>To cloſe this Chapter, We may judge of the thriving of popular States, by what we obſerve of Commons, which are always poor and bare of good and wholeſome Graſs, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively with Encloſures. If theſe Wafts be taken into one Mans hand, he cauſeth the fertile crop of Thiſtles to be Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtubbs up the Shrubs and Brambles, ploughs up the Brakes, trencheth and cultivates the Whole, and encreaſeth the profit four fold; whereas, when it lies in common, every one ſerves his preſent turn of it, overſtocks it, and nothing is bred upon it, but poor Jades and Beaſts of Burthen.</p>
               <p>Yea, the greater part of Men in a popular State, being bred up to gain, make Profit the rule of their Actions, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but little ſence of Honour, and thereby the State is ſoon corrupted by their low affections: ſo that though ſome may be rich, yet the State can never be glorious.</p>
               <p>In the ſtanding Pools of popular Government, from the putrilage and mud, ſpawn ſwarms of Tadpols. The rankneſs of ſuch ſoyl brings ſtore of Tares and Goſs, Docks and Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: Here the Henbane, Night-ſhade and Aconite grow too luxuriantly; ſo that the medicinal and fragrant Plants rarely find room or cultivation.</p>

               <p>I Shall now conſider all theſe forms of Commonwealths in groſs, and hope to ſatisfy the ingenuous and unbiaſs'd Reader, That if a People were in a capacity to chuſe their own Government, they ſhould have no reaſon to chuſe a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, rather than Kingly Government: much leſs that they ſhould endeavour to innovate or introduce it, where already ſo Geometrically compoſed as it is in <hi>England,</hi> both for the glory and benefit of the King and People.</p>
               <p>It is Judiciouſly noted by a late<note n="(a)" place="margin">

Through all which heads I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhew that in Commonwealths theſe Particulars cannot or have not ſo effectually been ſecured, as in a rightly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Monarchy.</p>

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:66310:29"/>
               <p>Thus in our late Republic, the great Buſineſs (even of the zealouſeſt Pretenders to the Public) was to enrich themſelves and their Confederates, as was apparent by the conſiderable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates they had, even after they had been forced to diſgorge thoſe fat Portions of Crown, Biſhops, Dean, and Chapter, and Cathedral Lands.</p>
               <p>By this obſervation we may conclude that the conſtituent parts of this Government, being ever like to be ſuch, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable People muſt be continually ſpunged, to feed ſo many greedy Worms, and when the Prey grows ſcarce, theſe Blood-Hounds will be ſure to fight who ſhall get the beſt Share.</p>

               <p>To inſtance in all the Factions in Commonwealths, were to write a voluminous Hiſtory. I ſhall touch upon ſome, and ſhow that the cauſes either given or taken will always be the ſame in theſe kinds of Government; the very Conſtitution of them, by the purity and equality of Dignity and Power, naturally producing Jealouſies, Animoſities and Aemulations: whereas the<note n="(d)" place="margin">

                  </note> Philoſopher well notes, that many may diſagree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, but one cannot. The difference of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to Conduct and Managery among multitudes of Equals embarraſſing Debates, the Reſult muſt be according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of ſome Faction: Every one Judging moſt advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of his own council and advice; and thoſe whoſe Councils are rejected, will look upon it as a Diminution of that eſteem for Wiſdom and Policy, which they think they deſerve, and theſe Diſcontents will occaſion making of Parties, entring into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies, and Combinations of Faction, and frequently end in popular Inſurrections, Tumults, and Diſorders, to which Republics, by their make are thus propenſe.</p>
               <p>Since therefore they are the ſeminaries of Faction, we can expect no wholeſome Fruit from ſuch corrupt Seed; for all factions endeavour to ſuppreſs their Oppoſites, and thoſe heats, underminings and jarrs, are not confined to their Senate-houſe, but are diſperſed, according to the places of their Reſidence, Eſtates; Marriages or Alliances, through the whole Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, every one ſtrengthening his Intereſt what he can; and the nature of Mankind being to ſide with one or other, if the Parties be Proud, Ambitious, Covetous, or Imperious, they will be moſt abſolute and arbitrary in ſuch places where
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66310:30"/>they can prevail; and if Perſons admitted to Copartnerſhip of Rule, be not of their own Nature guilty of ſuch Vices, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of every one to be reputed the wiſeſt, and to gain the leading of a Party, or obtain the ſupream Authority, are apt to taint ſuch, who being exalted, not born to Greatneſs, would have all to judg that ſuch Promotions are the pure-pute effects of their Merits, and whoever ſets that high value upon himſelf, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape the danger of unſupportable Pride, as well as Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which will hurry them on to over-bear all Oppoſition.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed to ſome few Inſtances of the Ruins brought upon many by Faction.<note place="margin">The <hi>Athenian</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Factions.</note> At <hi>Athens,</hi> after the death of <hi>Codrus,</hi> the race of their Hereditary Kings ceaſed, and there ſucceeded Kings for term of Life, like as the Elective Kings of <hi>Poland.</hi> After twelve ſuch Kings ending in <hi>Alcmenon,</hi> they conſtituted Decennial Kings, or <hi>Archontes,</hi> whereof <hi>Erixias</hi> was the laſt; and then they paſſed to annual Magiſtrates, like Lord Mayors, or Burgo-Maſters: and all theſe changes were by the prevalence of one Faction after another. <hi>Solon</hi> was one of theſe yearly Magiſtrates, and he compiled their Laws, ſuch as the <hi>Romans</hi> in after-times ſent to peruſe, and reduced into twelve Tables. Theſe were framed unto the Practice and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of popular Government, which in <hi>Solon's</hi> own Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time were violated, and almoſt extinguiſhed: for <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> the Son of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> finding the Citizens diſtracted betwixt two Factions, whereof <hi>Megacles</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> (two Citizens of noble Families) were become the heads, took occaſion by their contention and Inſolence, to raiſe a third Faction more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe more plauſible; for that he ſeemed a Protector of the Citizens in general: and having once got love and credit, he wounded himſelf, and feigned that by Malice of his Enemies, he had like to have been ſlain for his love to the good Citizens, and ſo procured a Guard, and made himſelf Lord: but he was ſoon driven out by <hi>Megacles</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and then the Aemulation began afreſh betwixt the former Factions; and <hi>Megacles</hi> finding himſelf too weak, called in <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> but he was once more expelled, and was reſtored a third time, and governed <hi>Athens</hi> ſeventeen Years, and his Son <hi>Hippias</hi> ſucceeded him, who was at laſt forced to fly to <hi>Darius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall under this Head only touch upon one example more in <hi>Athens.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concerning the 30 Tyrants of <hi>Athens.</hi>
                  </note> After the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> had ſubverted the Walls of <hi>Athens,</hi> thirty Men were appointed by the People to compile a Body of their Laws, and theſe had ſupream Authority, and were made Judges; and in caſes wherein the Laws were defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, had power to give Sentence according to their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. At firſt they exerciſed their Authority upon lewd and wicked Perſons, ſuch as were odious to the People. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all ſorts of People (under the notion of Perturbers of the Peace) were Fined, Impriſoned, or put to Death, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they among themſelves judged fit.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:66310:30"/>
               <p>To ſtrengthen their own Tyranny, they aſſociated three Thouſand Citizens to them, the reſt they diſarmed, exerciſing the greateſt Tyranny imaginable upon them, and agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves that every one ſhould name one, whoſe Goods ſhould be ſeized on, and the owner put to Death; upon which <hi>Theramenes,</hi> one of the Thirty diſcovering his deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at thoſe proceedings (though there had been a Law that none of the three Thouſand ſhould ſuffer Death at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Thirty, but have a legal Tryal) yet <hi>Critias,</hi> one of theſe thirty Tyrants, ordered <hi>Theramenes</hi>'s name to be blotted out of the Number. <hi>Theramenes</hi> urged the ill conſequence to the reſt of the Thirty, if without any juſt reaſon the names of any might be expunged by the overruling of one or more of the number; but every one thought fit rather to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his own Life by Silence, than preſently to draw upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the danger which as yet he thought concerned him little, and perhaps would never come near him: ſo the Tyrants interpreting Silence, Conſent; he was forthwith condemned, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to drink Poyſon.</p>
               <p>Theſe Proceedings cauſed many Citizens to fly, who under the conduct of <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> made head againſt them, and at laſt the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> removed the thirty Tyrants to <hi>Sparta;</hi> and the Citizens roſe againſt the Captains of the tyrannical Faction, and ſlew them as they were coming to a Parley, and ſo put an end to that worſt of Miſeries they had undergone, ſince thoſe thirty were conſtituted. In which ſad Hiſtory we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that theſe Tyrants were elected by the People, and at laſt after their outragious cruelties, were by the People deſtroyed: and no doubt they at firſt appeared ſuch to the People as they might confide in for Adminiſtration of Impartial Juſtice; into which belief they had cunningly bewitched them; and they were by the ſame Hands that raiſed them, demoliſhed. For as Sir<note n="(e)" place="margin">Hiſtory, <hi>p.</hi> 278.</note> 
                  <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> well obſerves in popular States, when any miſchief happens, the People take revenge on the Commanders; and where any Judgment is left to them (as in popular States, they will be always puſhing on for a Share) there will be very diſmal and indirect Proceedings: and when their Judgment proves ſound, it is by chance rather than otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of Factions in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi>
                  </note> Factious and diſorderly popular Government was as fatal as in any other place. <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Bomilcar</hi> were two famous Captains, but the heads of two ſeveral Factions, and ſuch Enemies to one another, that when they were choſen Generals againſt <hi>Agathocles, Bomilcar</hi> ſuffered <hi>Hanno</hi> to be cut in pieces rather than he would aſſiſt him. So <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> being joined againſt the Mercenaries, <hi>Amilcar</hi> could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form nothing by reaſon of the envy of <hi>Hanno,</hi> till for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service ſake they were made Friends.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Barchine</hi> Family (of which <hi>Hannibal</hi> was the third in Succeſſion that was General of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>) had the greateſt Intereſt both in the Senate, and among the People for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66310:31"/>ſome time; none being able either to tax his, or his Families Vertue, or to perform the like ſervice for the Commonweal. Yet we find, that when <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his Brother <hi>Mago,</hi> had ſo far overrun <hi>Italy,</hi> that nothing but the ſupply of Men and Money, to compleat the Conqueſt, was wanting; yet the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Hanno</hi> wrought upon the people (not by detracting from the Valour and Conduct of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and the Family, but by the general reprehenſion of the War) that when <hi>Mago</hi> was ſent over for Recruits, he had wrought ſo on the covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe that were loth to lay out their Money before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme neceſſity required it, and had more feeling of their own preſent commodity, than ſence of the publick need; that he got little encouragement: and when the matter being propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the People, they yielded to a ſupply, yet <hi>Hanno</hi> and his Party gave ſo many impediments to the Execution, ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the danger, that if <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his Brother conquered, he would make himſelf King, that by that means, he cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undermined that brave man, and brought at laſt ruin upon the whole Commonwealth. When <hi>Scipio</hi> (without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance of the Senate, but with the concurrence of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) tranſlated the War to <hi>Africk,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were forced to recal <hi>Hannibal, who not able to maſter <hi>Scipio,</hi>

               <p>If we had never heard of any ſuch thing in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet we had the too late calamitous experience of it, in our late Republican Government; which was no longer able to ſubſiſt, but while it had an Army (maintained at the charge of the enſlaved People) to ſecure them: yet they falling into Factions themſelves, their Army did ſo likewiſe, and the Houſes and Army at laſt came to have ſeveral Intereſts, and to have competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Sovereignty (which any wiſe man might have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen) and at laſt, the Army being divided, the happy Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the King was thereby much facilitated.</p>

               <p>In all Wars nothing is more requiſite than Unity of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and Secrecy in the conduct of Affairs, which is moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be obtained, where many are at the Helm.

               <p>Beſides, in the Multitude of Councellors (if there happen any notable miſcarriages of State) there is ſafety to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.<note place="margin">In Miſcarriages, the Authors difficultly known.</note> It being difficult to fix it upon any one ſingle perſon, every one ſhrowding himſelf in the complex Act of the whole: So that though they ſingly put in for the glory of proſperous Atchievements; yet in unfortunate or unlucky Councils and Actions, they skreen themſelves under the majority of Votes; which becauſe they always may do, it muſt neceſſarily make ſome more Supine, and leſs Vigilant over the Publick.

               <p>Beſides, when Men are thus eſtabliſhed in Power, few can have Redreſs for their private injuries and wrongs, being that every complaint would but look like contempt of Authority; becauſe the Party oppreſſing, being one of the Aſſociates in

               <p>The Nation was then, and ever will be: under any Uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Republic, in worſe than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage.

Every one that would not worſhip thoſe Pagods, were proceeded againſt by ſome of thoſe, or their Arbitrary High Courts of Juſtice, or were convened before the Houſe of Commons, where every one of thoſe Parliament Demarchs were as abſolute as the Laws of their own will could make them.</p>
               <p>No Perſon could either queſtion their Actions or Authority, but he paid his Life or Fortune, or one of them, for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: ſo that we ſaw the whole Kingdom brought into a

For here <hi>Q. Fabius</hi> was accounted the Oracle of his time; for his wary Nature ſuited well with the Buſineſs that fell out in the chief of his Imployment; therefore others adhered to him, that was grown old in following one Courſe, from which they would not ſhift as the change of Times required. But the People (who though they could not well adviſe and deliberate, yet could well apprehend) embraced the needful Motion of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and furniſhed him with all Supplies and Furtherance they could.</p>
               <p>From hence I may note the Inconvenience of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein ſometimes the Senators ſhall be led by one, or ſome few, one way, and then by others, and ſometimes the People ſhall over-rule the Votes of the Senate: For though this may be fortunate at ſome times, yet at others it may be as fatal.</p>
               <p>The great Succeſs of <hi>Scipio</hi> was celebrated with that exceſs of Joy, and deſervedly, as <hi>Rome</hi> perhaps never ſhew'd the like; and his Brother <hi>L.

Yet theſe two ſo famous Brothers afterwards were called, one after another, by two <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the People, to Judgment, in probability by the inſtigation of ſome of the Faction of the Senate againſt them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>African</hi> could not endure that ſuch unworthy Men ſhould queſtion him of purloining from the common Treaſure, or of being hired by <hi>Antiochus</hi> to make an ill Bargain for his Country: When therefore the Day of Anſwer came, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66310:36"/>before the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> not humbled as one accuſed, but followed by a great Train of his Friends and Clients, with which he paſſed through the midſt of the Aſſembly; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Audience, told the People, That upon the ſame day of the Year he fought a great Battel againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and finiſhed the <hi>Punic</hi> War by a ſignal Victory: In memory of which, he thought it no fit Seaſon to brabble at the Law, but intended to viſit the Capitol, and there give Thanks to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the reſt of the Gods, by whoſe Grace, both on that day, and at other times, he had well and happily diſcharged the moſt weighty Buſineſs of the Commonweal; and that if from the ſeventeenth Year of his Life, until he now grew old, the Honourable Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by them conferred on him, had prevented the Capacity of his Age, and yet his Deſerts had exceeded the Greatneſs of thoſe Honourable Places, that then they would pray, That the Princes and Great ones of the City might ſtill be like to him. So all followed him, except the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> and their Slaves, and one of the Cryers, by whom ridiculouſly they cited him to Judgment, until for very ſhame (as not knowing what elſe to do) they granted him, unrequeſted, a longer Day.</p>
               <p>But after, when he perceived that the <hi>Tribunes</hi> would not let fall the Suit, he willingly withdrew from that unthankful <hi>Rome,</hi> that could ſuffer him to undergo ſuch Indignities, and ſo ſpent the reſt of his time at <hi>Linternum.</hi>

               <p>It is obſerved, That <hi>Cato</hi> the elder (who had been his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer) was a Promoter of this.

Ambition was his Vice, which being joyned with Envy, troubled both himſelf, and the whole City: And ſome write, That <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> out of ſome private diſpleaſure, countenanced theſe Proceedings.</p>

               <p>IN the commendation of Monarchy, all Authors are ſo copious, that it is more difficult to order and compoſe with Beauty, the Jewels of the Crown, than to amaſs and heap them. That it hath been the moſt Antient and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Government of the World, we have the Univerſal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage and Teſtimony of all the preſerved Records of remoteſt Ages; Royal Authority and Kings being coaeval with what ever Monuments we find of the Origin of Nations.</p>

For it cannot be doubted, but that the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> during his life, were his Subjects, both by the Law of God and Nature: The Charter of God Almighty giving to <hi>Adam,</hi> Dominion over all the inferior Creation; and to <hi>Noah,</hi> over every living Creature.

               <p>Beſides, it is a ſtrong Argument for the Preference of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Government to all ſorts of Republics, that in all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular States, we find all great affairs managed by ſome one leading Man, who by the dexterity of his Addreſs, Power of his Eloquence, or the Strength of his Arguments, induceth ſo many as are neceſſary to join with him to effect them, unleſs when by contrary renitency they are diſſolved into Faction.</p>

               <p>The ſingle Government being freed from the prime Cauſe of all inteſtine decay, <hi>viz.</hi> Faction: It neceſſarily follows that it muſt be of longer Duration,<note place="margin">Monarchy more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> as being built upon ſtronger and firmer Foundations than any other Model. Ambitions, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations, Hoſtile Parities, popular Inſolencies, Senatorian Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, tumultuous Elections, and infinite cauſes of Diſcords
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66310:41"/>are the inſeparable Aſſociates, and cloſe Conomitants of all other Forms. But in Monarchy, hereditary Succeſſion is as a Golden Chain, that holds faſt together and cloſe every part of the Royal Contexture in it ſelf, and leaves no Chaſms, Chinks, or Ruptures, whereby any diſſolving cauſe can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted entrance to ſubvert or disjoint the Frame.</p>
               <p>I have before ſpoke of this Head, and ſhall only add, that as Kingly Government was the firſt; ſo when Commonwealths were introduced with much ſtrugling, they kept Life a while in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> but have been reduced to Monarchy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain about one Thouſand ſeven Hundred Years ſince.</p>

               <p>But this is only true where Monarchy is Abſolute, Arbitrary, and Unbounded; which in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy is much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. For though the Kings of <hi>England</hi> (where they have not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded themſelves by their gracious Condeſcentions and Grants to their People) are not limited by any other Power than their own Royal Pleaſure: Yet their Conceſſions have been ſo many, and formed into Laws (as Meaſures and Standards of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that they are Mounds and Boundaries, which the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy hath no leſs Prudently than Indulgently been pleaſed to give it ſelf, thereby to eaſe the Subject of any juſt occaſion of Fears or Jealouſies (which receive their Birth from the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable redundancy of their abſolute Power) and by this means the Government is ſecured from the falling intoan Arbitrary and Tyrannical way of Rulers, and the Minds of the Subjects freed from the dreadful apprehenſion of Slavery. And as by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable method of goodneſs, and generoſity in our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Subjects of all conditions are the more powerfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to all dutiful Allegiance to their temperate Government; ſo the Government it ſelf is thereby rendred more capable of effectually anſwering all the Ends and Intentions of Society.</p>
               <p>When it is debated whether Monarchy or Tyranny be the moſt convenient Government; the true Sence of it is this,<note place="margin">Compariſon betwixt a King and Tyrant.</note> Whether the People ſhall live more happily when the ſupream Power is in one, and the Perſon by the Laws of the Country is known, whereby no Room is left for Diviſion and Faction, concerning that ſingle Sovereign? Or, When one Man, being more active and crafty than his Fellows, who ought to have an equal ſhare in the Authority, raiſes a Faction upon ſome plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pretences, and under the colour of ſerving his Confederated Party, perſwades them to be commanded by him, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes the ſupream Power in an Illegal way: which as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by engaging the People in miſery, under colour of making them more happy; ſo it muſt be kept up by as bad Arts, and an Army muſt be maintained to make good by force what Law cannot juſtify.</p>
               <p>In this manner as the queſtion is to be ſtated betwixt a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King and Tyrant. So if it be enquired whether Monarchy or Ariſtocracy be better; it is not whether a bad King be better than a good Commonwealth conſiſting of the Optimacy: but the Compariſon ought to be betwixt a good King, and a good Ariſtocracy, or betwixt them when both bad.</p>

               <p>Suppoſing both the King and Optimacy be willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Peoples Happineſs; yet he is more able to compaſs that End, by reaſon he hath a more United Power, and the Execution of all Deſigns depends upon a ſingle reſolve; and therefore may be managed with a certain cloſeneſs and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſwiftneſs, ſo that good Councils ſhall be firſt diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their effects: Whereas a great Body move ſlowly, and moſt times the opportunity of Doing is gone by, while they are but half way in their deliberation.</p>

                  </note> as there are many Advantages peculiar to Monarchy (as in theſe three Chapters I hope I have evinced) ſo there is not one Inconvenience, to which a People, living under Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy, are not ſubject in a much higher Degree than they are under Monarchy. For ſuppoſing a King cruel, yet one Man's Cruelty cannot reach ſo many as that of Multiplied oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, when every one takes their peculiar Province to fleece, or exerciſe their Lordlineſs over, according as their Eſtates or Intereſts are divided.</p>
               <p>The Covetouſneſs likewiſe of Senators is more devouring, becauſe we may feed one Fire with leſs Expence of Fewel than five Hundred.</p>
               <p>A Princes profuſe Largeſſes to his Favourites, is infinitely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-balanced, by ſo many providing for their poor Kindred, and making Friends, and purchaſing Dependants. This very thing muſt likewiſe be practiſed by Senators, for underproping their ſeveral reputations, hiring Advocates to plead for them in their abſence; purchaſing of Votes in their private concerns, and obtaining of Offices, Places and Eſtates for themſelves and their Relations: So that theſe muſt require more conſiderable Supplies from the People (who muſt be ſqueezed every time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſingle Grandee wants) than are neceſſary to nouriſh the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of a Prince, who hath a large Patrimony, ſtanding Revenue, and places of Honour and Profit to gratify his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants withal. The wiſeſt States having made ample allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to their Princes, to enable them to beſtow Favours accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Merits or liking.</p>

For the cauſe of thoſe Miſeries foretold is plainly thus: A King during his Infancy, being not able perſonally to Rule, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is managed by the Nobles; and thence come Factions, and all the Miſchiefs that accompany them.</p>
               <p>To cloſe therefore this Chapter, we may conſider, that Kings have no Rivals whom they fear, and muſt keep under, as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Commonwealths have; which is no ſmall Bleſſing to a People.</p>

And whatever Evil Miniſters Kings are ſaid to have, yet what that Judicious Author notes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> we may ſay the like of <hi>England,</hi> That after they had taken from the Bleſſed King his Prerogative of chuſing Judges and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors; the Parliament did the next year put in (I will not ſay with him, the greateſt Blockheads and Idiots in the Nation but) men of much meaner Parts, and more corrupt and unfit, either for knowledge, or the upright diſpenſing of the Laws, Juſtice and Equity, than any Age had known.</p>
               <p>I have diſcourſed of this Head before, and ſo ſhall ſay no more, but that as well as in Antient times, the unequal Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Juſtice hath been noted; ſo the Severity of the State of <hi>Venice</hi> againſt their Nobles, and the executing Men without Citing or Hearing, upon meer Jealouſies, induced a wiſe <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> (who hath collected the Arbitrary Courſes practiſed and allowed in that State) to ſay, That there is leſs of Liberty there, than under the worſt of Monarchies.

By them their Allies have been unworthily deſerted; In the matter of Trade no Pact or Faith hath been kept.

               <p>From hence we may learn how great Deference hath been paid to Princes, who have pretended Obedience to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, or had Converſation with Celeſtial Miniſters, Spirits or Angels; and how uſeful, true and untainted Religion in a Prince muſt be, when the Umbrage of it is owned to make ſo pleaſant and beneficial a ſhade.</p>

For, ſaith my Author, the Ancients would preſerve nothing in this City by which the Minds of Men might be withdrawn or led aſide from the Worſhip of the Gods.</p>
               <p>From this Story I ſhall firſt mark, <hi>obiter,</hi> that it ſeems for want of the engraving theſe Inſtitutions of <hi>Numa</hi> concerning Religion, in Braſs, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws were, though the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Prieſts had the ordering them ever ſince; yet there was that alteration made in that long interval of time in the Rites and Ceremonies, from what he had inſtituted, that to have reduced them to their practice was like to un-hinge all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Eccleſiaſtical Polity; and ſo the Senate, Conſuls and Prieſts thought it more adviſeable to burn and annihilate them, than to diſorder the preſent Eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We may note, that the Senate and Conſuls took care that nothing ſhould be expoſed to the People (how ſacred a Relique ſoever) that might enervate or debilitate Religion.</p>
               <p>Now we may further note out of a judicious<note n="(a)" place="margin">Dionyſ. Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſaeus, lib. <hi>11.</hi>

He alſo further declared that thoſe who uſurp'd upon the Limits of others Poſſeſſions, were not only to be puniſhed here, but were doomed to Torments in Hell; to the end that every Man might be afraid to ſeize on the Goods of another Mans.</p>
               <p>Theſe therefore I look upon as the Fundamentals of civil Religion, in the rendring ſo venerable the Faith by Oaths, whereby not only Allegiance to the Prince, but Society was eſtabliſhed upon that firm Baſis of mutual Confidence: and by the ſecuring Propriety, the whole Compages of Government was preſerved.</p>
               <p>We ought likewiſe to conſider that there are moral Vertues which conciliate ſuch a Reverence to the Practiſers of them,<note place="margin">Moral Vertues ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that they are great helps to preſerve and make flouriſhing every Kingdom and Commonweal, and which conſtitute a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Religious Portion of civil Government; and when Princes and People exerciſe them, both live happilier, than when without them, great Sanctity and Devotion are only pretended.</p>
               <p>The Vertues I put in the Balance againſt Bigotry in Religion,<note place="margin">Better than Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Holineſs.</note> are Juſtice, Temperance, Charity, Fortitude, Magnanimity, which are branched out into many flouriſhing Boughs, that bear the Golden Fruit upon them; ſuch as theſe, Not to do to another that which we would not have done to our ſelves; To live contentedly in our Station; To be obedient to our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Superiours; To live in Charity with all Men; To be Compaſſionate to the Poor and Needy; To give no evil Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in any ſort of Debauchery; To conſider that we come into this World to live according to the rules of Life, the Sovereign Being of all hath pleaſed to reveal; That we do nothing here which may forfeit our more durable Inheritance in the other World.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the Buttreſſes of Government in the Heathen World, when the whole train of Moral Vertues without Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and Diſſimulation were practiſed: and can <hi>Machiavel</hi> or any of his Diſciples find that the ſame things are not preſſed as a duty upon all in the Chriſtian Religion; there ſeeming to me this only advantageous difference, That the Foundation and Baſis upon which theſe Moral Vertues reſt in the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is more firm, more regular, and more curiouſly hewen and poliſhed, and more conſentaneous to the Dictates of right Reaſon, in that they are implanted and promulged as ſtanding Laws by one God Omnipotent; than in the multiform, jarring Polytheiſm of the Heathens, who for every different Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of things, or qualifications of Beings, introduced a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Spirit.</p>

               <p>It muſt be confeſſed,<note place="margin">True Piety leſſened by ſubtile Diſputes.</note> that ſince Religion hath been reduced from Precepts and Axioms to Syſtems, and that the practical part of Juſtice, Moral Vertues and Honeſty, were no longer in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, than as they were found ſubſervient to the promoting Speculations; there hath been a way found out to render theſe fundamental and ſubſtantial Qualifications of leſs value in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Men, unleſs withal they added ſome quaint Notions that might ſublime their Heatheniſh Moralities (as they call them) into Elixirs and quinteſſences of Religion: as in our late Times, If one could not give a certain Diagnoſtick when Grace was wrought in him, he was not fit for reforming Employment; Men being more diſtinguiſhed by Teſts and Oaths, than by good Manners.</p>
               <p>By which we forgo the Subſtance of Moral Piety for a fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Shadow; and many are ſo bigotted in their ſeveral Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it is a more arduous task of late, than formerly, for Princes to comport themſelves in this particular, ſo as to keep in one Uniformity, Subjects of ſo different Perſwaſions, whereby they may command that obedience Subjects ought to pay to their Sovereigns.</p>
               <p>To find Expedients, or offer any directions to Princes in this Caſe, were to involve ones ſelf in an endleſs Labyrinth, and diſcover an unpardonable Preſumption; the Difficulties being very great, if not inſuperable, how to frame Laws that ſhould combine ſuch varieties and diverſities of Opinions in one Yoak, Order or Rule, without ſuch an univerſal and abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, as ſcarce in Idaea, much leſs in Practice can ever be.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore concern my ſelf no way in tugging at the end of that Saw of Controverſies, which (how pleaſant ſoever it may be to ſuch as have an over-weening Opinion of their Knowledge in ſuch Subtilties) is very harſh and ungrateful to my Temper.</p>
               <p>This one <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> or <hi>Poſtulatum,</hi> however, I hope few will deny, That ſince Monarchy is the Eſtabliſhed Government in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66310:48"/>his Majeſtie's Dominions, and however maliciouſly and potently aſſaulted in our Memories; yet never can be altered here.<note place="margin">The Government of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> agreeable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy.</note> Princes by ſmall ſearches into the aptitude of the ſeveral Schemes of religious Worſhip and Government, may ſoon find which is moſt agreeable to the Conſtitution of the Monarchy, and will be moſt ſubſervient to it. In which particular, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as eſtabliſhed by Law, in its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Diſcipline, and all the true Members of it, and the Subjects of all Conditions, who act according to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it; have obtain'd a Royal and Gracious Character, founded upon the conſtant Experience the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have had, That upon all the moſt critical trials, the Members of it have ſtood firm to the Crown, even when worn by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of different Religion.</p>
               <p>Therefore till other Forms, practiſed in the late times, can give as undeniable Proofs of their unconditionate Loyalties; I think it but reaſonable they ſhould allow His Majeſty liberty to conſult his own, and the intereſt of his Government, rather than their inconſiſtent Models.</p>
               <p>One of the Principles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that of the Chriſtian Religion.) is, That it teacheth O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Soveraign, not for Fear only, but for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake; and all conſiderate (as well as Pious Men) where they are convinced, That it is better to obey God than Man (if any thing ſhould be commanded that would put them upon that Dilemma) will chuſe to ſuffer (if they cannot fly) rather than rebel.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſince it pleaſed his Majeſty at his firſt Step to the Royal Throne (which was like that of the riſing Sun diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing innumerable Bleſſings to his People) to expreſs his Royal Favour to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>

               <p>Since which, by the repeated ſolemnity of it to his two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament, all ſuſpicion of his Majeſtie's ever acting to the contrary, ſo long as the Subjects keep their dutiful Station, is totally removed.

For as Dominions are circumſcribed, and bear one againſt another, for the preſerving of their reſpective Limits and Bounds, ſo that a kind of Hereditary Hoſtility is continued betwixt them: So we find together with that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive civil Enmity, there is alſo ſome diſagreeing in ſuch Points of Religion, as is ſufficient to keep up the Feud betwixt the Learned Part, as well as the Common People; and the Earth is not more diverſifyed by the large Tracts of Sands in <hi>Arabia,</hi>

               <q>
                  <l>—cum ſolos credit habendos</l>

               </q>
               <p>What Application is to be made of God Almightie's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Providence in this I leave to Divines, whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it is: Only we may obſerve, ſince the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is obeyed in a large Portion of the World, and Ethniciſm and Turciſm poſſeſs as great Territories, and the different Modes in all theſe (ſome inſiſting on old Uſage, others on Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Refinings) are ſo conſiderable, it is not to be hoped, there can be any Uniformity or Harmony of Religions in the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore it ſeems to be the great concern of Princes in their ſeveral Dominions, to uſe their utmoſt Endeavours, that the great Fundamentals of Religion (which conſiſt in ſolid Piety, Juſtice, Temperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſhould be ſtrictly obſerved, and the particular Forms, which, by the Wiſdom of forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, have been adapted to the <hi>Genius</hi> of their People, ſhould be protected and defended, and no Innovations made in them upon private Mens Fancies of Reformation, without a publick Sanction.</p>
               <p>As to the third Particular concerning the Diverſities of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Religion,<note place="margin">Fanaticalneſs in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion dangerous to Government.</note> which have been ſpawned in our late Wars, during the Rebellion, when every one pretended, that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of propagating their ſeveral new found Opinions, was what they had fought for, and purchaſed with the expence of their Blood and Treaſure, we may conſider theſe things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That when Religion is only ſeated in the Brain, it ſtrangely infatuates, and renders the poſſeſſed difficult to be cured: for it either produceth downright Hypocriſie (which hath Millions of Subſervient Wheedles to accompany it) or the Imagination is heightened, That (as a learned<note n="(g)" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Fr. White</hi>'s Sacred Laws.</note> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obſerves) they think Salvation is only ordained for thoſe of their fine Sculls; the very moſſy Notions of which they think ſufficient cure for the falling Evil: Judging Mankind, till within a Century or ſo, to have been dull indigeſted Maſſes of unthinking Animals; whereas in Truth and Reality, they are the <hi>tubera Terrae,</hi> Inſipid or Poyſonous Fungs, which ſprung up by the Showres of Blood.</p>
               <p>Under this Ecſtaſie of new Beams of Light, they are ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the Opinion of their own Saintſhip, and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge themſelves in all the ſweet Appetites of Spiritual Pride, affected Sanctity, and ſingularity of Perſwaſion; for without ſome odd Notion (more ſubtile than others have or a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66310:50"/>as if dropped from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s third Heaven, they have no Hearts-eaſe; and having the Maggot turn'd into a Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flie, O how it flutters and mutes its Eggs upon every freſh Colewort!</p>
               <p>This kind of Brain-ſick Religion, is no ſooner born,<note place="margin">Idem.</note> but preſently like <hi>Cadmus</hi>'s iſſue, it falls to war under the Banner of Reformation, which is that Fort Spiritual, that <hi>Palladium,</hi> they muſt defend; and thereby promiſe to themſelves Laurels and Palms, which ſhall cover and protect them from all the <hi>bruta Fulmina,</hi> as they repute them, of the National Church; thinking themſelves above the Juriſdiction of any Eccleſiaſtical Court, their Dominion being founded in Grace.</p>
               <p>The pretence of maintaining Religion, or the ſham-affrights ſuch People divulge they have of it, being altering, or taken from them, may, with the leaſt danger to the Deſigners of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Revolution, be uſed as a blind to carry on any Intriegue; and the pretence of refining Religion, hath powerful Philtres and Faſcinations, to bewitch the Unwary, and tickle the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</p>
               <p>While ſuch like Religious People, as I have been deſcribing, in the late miſerable times (when there was neither Lawful, Civil, or Eccleſiaſtical Authority) obtained Power, theſe Glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms were as plentiful as Locuſts, filling every place with new, but not uniform Light; nothing was more common in their Mouths, than that the Diſpenſation or Goſpel of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt was to be expected, that of God Almighty being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away, at the coming of our Saviour, and His Sacred Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments being to ceaſe at the approach of this.</p>
               <p>What wild fancies, What Hereſies revived, were then in Vogue, I had rather were forgot than ſhown upon the Stage: and only ſhall obſerve, that ſince Religion is like the Heart in the Body, full of Vital Spirits, it encreaſeth the care of a Sovereign, That neither the Divine Fire be ſufflaminated or extinguiſhed by Irreligion or Atheiſm; nor by Enthuſiaſm ſo ſublimed, as it cauſe a Calenture.</p>
               <p>As to the laſt Particular, it is ſo nice a point (now eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that I had once deſigned not to have touched upon it;<note place="margin">Concerning Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion.</note> but that I may not wholly fruſtrate Expectation in ſaying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I ſhall Content my ſelf with ſumming up ſome few Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities from <hi>Lipſius,</hi> and others upon this Subject.</p>

               <p>By this all Men (as well as Princes) take mature Counſel, conſider things good and evil, commodious and incommodious, examine all Inſtruments, as to their fitneſs and unfitneſs, compare Circumſtances, reviſe Examples, conſider of timing of Buſineſs, Places and Perſons, natural tendencies, and where Authority is to be uſed, and where Suaſives; how to countermine, how to penetrate into hidden Counſels of others, and to unmask their Diſguiſes; to ruminate upon things by-paſt, to order the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and provide for the future.</p>

               <p>It were endleſs to remember all the Benefits that accrue to a Prince and his People by this only Vertue, Prudence. Be the Body of the Commonwealth in a Calenture by Factions and Seditions, a prudent Prince knows how to extinguiſh the Fire, by ſubſtracting the Feeders, or breaking the Force of it, by ſubdividing the complication of Cauſes, or diverting of it ſome other way. Doth it bleed by a Civil War? He can bind up the Wound. Does it ſuffer by want of Nouriſhment? He can ſupply it with ſuitable Food, that will neither pamper it to an unwieldy Sloth, or luxurious Licentiouſneſs: He can by Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Drenching clear it of all its ſuperfluous Humours: He can aſſwage its Pains by removing Grievances or Oppreſſions: He can invigorate every languid part, by cordial Privileges and wholeſom Laws; can ſet ſtrait its diſlocated or diſtorted Joynts, when any of the great Officers or Magiſtrates faulter, limp, or halt in their Duties. <hi>Medaea</hi> never knew ſo many Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick Herbs to renew the old Age of <hi>Jaſon,</hi> as a prudent Prince doth Rules and Methods to cure all the Diſtempers of his Kingdom, preſerve it in a perfect Health, or reſtore it when declining.</p>

For he is very fool-hardy, or deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately Revengeful, that will challenge a ſingle Man who is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented to have Valour and Skill at his Weapon: much more is he who knowing his Prince ſuch an one, and who hath the Power of his Kingdom to aſſiſt and defend him, will offer to moleſt his peaceable Reign, unleſs he find ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious opportunity ſtrangely favourable to his Deſign, or take ſome Seaſon before ſuch a Prince be well ſetled in his Throne (as deſpairing ever after to effect any thing) and be in that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Condition, that if he then cannot puſh forward his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, he muſt for ever live inglorious and miſerable.

For although there is a Co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Members with the Head, for the performing ſome Acts of State, and they may ſeem Orders or States coaequally Authorized in the Power of Acting with the Sovereign, in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning for, adviſing, or conſulting about, or conſenting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kings Summons to Laws. And although in judging and determining matters of Private Intereſt, the King hath not an Arbitrary Judgment, but is reſtrained to the Judgment, to be adminiſtred by the proper ſworn Judges in his Courts, whom he appoints to judge according to his Laws; and in the making of Laws, his Power and Judgment is reſtrained to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Nobles, and Commons in Parliament: yet in all other things (wherein he is not expreſly reſtricted by any Law of his own or Progenitors granting) he retaineth the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power, as in the particulars before mentioned, and in the Chapters of Parliaments I ſhall further diſcourſe.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66310:70"/>of that of the Philoſopher, That the King was <hi>Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis major,</hi> but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſis minor:</hi> Inferring from thence, That the Collective Body of the People, and their Repreſentatives, were Greater in Authority than the King.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which, it may be obſerved, That the Aphoriſm, how true ſoever in any other ſenſe, is moſt falſe, in any ſenſe, of Sovereignty. For, if it be meant, That the King is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Man only than any of us ſingle, this doth not tell us he is better than Two; and this is no more than poſſibly he might be before he was King: For we muſt needs look upon Princes, as Perſons of Worth, Honour, and Eminency, when taken from the People; which the ſuperaddition of Royalty did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. Beſides, any Lord of the Land may challenge ſuch a Supremacy over all the Knights, and any Knight over all the Eſquires. Furthermore, if Princes be Sovereigns to ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Subjects only, and not to the univerſality of them, then every ſingle Subject by himſelf is a Body Politick, whereof the King, as King, is Head; and ſo the Publick Community is out of the King's Protection, he being no King as to them in a complex Body. Such impudent Falſities, and many more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Conſequences, flow from ſuch abſurd Principles: And if the Maxim were true, the People have placed a King not over, but under themſelves.</p>
               <p>But they enforce the Argument ſtill further, That the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and efficient Cauſe of Power is the People; and from hence, they ſay, the Inference is juſt, That he is leſs than the Univerſe. But the<note n="(w)" place="margin">Anſwer to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> Conſequence is rather the contrary: For, ſuppoſe the People were the efficient Cauſe of Power, it can be no otherwiſe than by tranſlating, or deriving their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Power, and uniting it in him. Since then they cannot retain what they have parted with, nor have what they gave away, it follows, That he who hath all their Power, and his own particular beſides, muſt needs be greater, and more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful than they; it being a very great Truth, That he is the only Fountain of Power and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Another of their Maxims was, That <hi>quicquid efficit tale, illud eſt magis tale:</hi> And they aſſume, But the King was made by the People, therefore leſs than the People. In anſwer to which, it is apparent, the Argument is Sophiſtical, as being built on a Maxim in it ſelf amphibolous, which is not ſimply true, but as it is reſtricted: For it is true before the Effect produced, not after. So a Spark firing a City, was once more Fire than the Houſes; but not ſo after the whole Town is become a Flame. It is true alſo in thoſe Agents in whom the Quality by which they operate is inherent; not true in thoſe who by ways of Donation diveſt themſelves of Power or Wealth. For a thing cannot retain its Fulneſs, after it hath emptied it ſelf. If the Objector have an Eſtate, which he would willingly improve, let him beſtow it on another, and he ſhall make him rich, and, by his own Argument, himſelf richer: It is to be ſuppoſed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66310:71"/>than ſuch an one will part with his Eſtate, he will find an Anſwer to his Objection.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition, I have before cleared, I hope, That the People are not the Original Cauſe of Government, But the Obſerver ſaith, They are the Final Cauſe; and the End is far more valuable in Nature and Policy, than that which is the Means: therefore the Commons, whoſe Good is the final End of all Government, are more Honourable than the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. But the Rule holds in ſuch Means only as are valuable by that relation they bear to their Ends, and have no proper Goodneſs of their own. A King is not ſo to his People. If we look back to his firſt Extraction, when he was firſt taken from the People to be ſet over them, we muſt needs behold him as a Man of ſome Worth, Honour, and Eminence; which the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addition of Royalty did not deſtroy, but encreaſe; and to be a means of his Peoples Preſervation, is very conſiſtent with the Heighth of Honour. Beſides, they that would captivate the unthinking Multitude by ſuch Fallacies, muſt conſider, that the Queſtion is not, Who is Preferable, but, Who is Superiour. One good Chriſtian is preferable to a thouſand that are not ſo; yet his Intereſt in the Commonwealth may not be preferable. A Shepherd is ordained for his Flock; yet a Flock of Brutes is not preferable to any Reaſonable Creature. Further, the King's Intereſt and the Peoples are inſeparable in the Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Law, which preſumes, what the King doth, he does for the People. Whether therefore the King's Power be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from God, or the People, it is preferable. If from God, becauſe his Ordinance: If from the People, becauſe the People have elected him, and conſented it<note n="(x)" place="margin">Jus Regium. p. <hi>68.</hi>
                  </note> ſhould be, and have truſted him with the Publick Intereſt, which is ſtill preferable.</p>
               <p>If this way of arguing were ſound, Angels being Miniſtring Spirits for the good of Men, it would follow, That Men ſhould be more Honourable than Angels; and the poor Client ſhould be a better Man than his Learned Counſellor; and the ſimple Patient, than his Doctor.</p>

               <p>If there were no other Motive to induce me to treat of this Head, the barbarous Murther of the Bleſſed Martyr King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, would have the ſame power as the ſenſe that <hi>Croeſus</hi>'s dumb Son had to ſee his Father's Life in imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which made ſuch a violent emotion of the Spirits, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſned the ſtiff Ligaments by which his Tongue was contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or forced an Irruption of Powerful Spirits to invigorate the paralytick Muſcles of it, ſo that he cried out, <hi>Spare my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> So certainly the Conſideration of ſuch an High Court of Juſtice, that arraigned and ſentenced their Sovereign, ſhould raiſe an Indignation in any one that hath ſenſe of Allegiance, Duty, or Religion, to defend that as a Fundamental Truth, That Sovereigns are ſubject to no Tribunal but that of their Heavenly Sovereign.</p>
               <p>In the handling this, I ſhall pick out ſome of the Aſſertions of Learned and Judicious Authors, Heathens and Chriſtians, and annex and interſperſe ſuch Reaſons as may evince it; and then ſhow, That this doth not leave Princes to a Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Liberty; and laſtly, give ſome ſhort Remarks upon the unparallell'd Sentence of the Regicides of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of Immortal Memory.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66310:75"/>which the Emperor is more obnoxious than to the Law, and that is Equity, which is not always found written: Now if the Law doth command one thing, and Equity perſwade another. It is fit the Emperor ſhould temper the Rigor of the Law with the Bridle of Equity; as he, who alone may, and ought to look unto that Interpretation, which lyeth interpoſed betwixt Law and Equity; ſince no Law can ſufficiently anſwer the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties and unthought on plottings of Mans Nature, and in Tract of Time, Laws at firſt, juſt, or <hi>in terrorem,</hi> become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and harſh: and this moderating of Laws (which is called, ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Equity) is ſo annexed to the Prince, that by no decree of Man it can be pulled from it.</p>
               <p>This Abſoluteneſs I have hitherto mentioned out of ſuch great Authors,<note place="margin">How far the Kings of <hi>England</hi> may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with their Laws.</note> is not practiſed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sovereign; for he challengeth no ſuch Power to make or abrogate Laws, without the Concurrence of the two Houes: But he hath a ſufficient Prerogative by diſpenſing, conniving or putting ſome Laws more in Execution than at other times, ſo to manage the Execution of the, as the Government, and conſequently the Peoples ſafety be not prejudiced. So though there be a Law for Triennial Parliaments; yet when a Prince finds a Potent Faction that may influence the Electors, ſo as the meeting of ſuch a Parliament at ſuch a time, may be hazardous to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, there being no Penalty can be inflicted on a King for the Omiſſion, and the Danger being viſible, that ſuch a Factious Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was only wanting, to bring to perfection the Deſign of Traiterous and Seditious Perſons: It is very agreeable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that a Prince, in ſuch a juncture, ſhould prefer the publick Peace of his Kingdom, and the ſecurity of his Crown (by the omitting ſuch Summons) than to hazard all by convening them. There are other Caſes may intervene, wherein the Reaſon of State, the <hi>Salus publica,</hi> may require the diſpenſing with, or ſuſpenſion of the Execution of ſome Laws: As in time of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Rebellion, the King's arming of ſuch as he may moſt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confide in, though they take not ſuch Oaths, or be ſo qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Laws require, and as in ſeveral other Particulars, might be inſtanced in.</p>

               <p>OUR Republicans of 1641. ſet themſelves, with all their skill and cunning,<note place="margin">The Neceſſity of this Diſcourſe.</note> as well as force, to overthrow the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance; and to eſtabliſh that of its being lawful, not only to riſe in Arms, for the defence of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Property and Religion (the gilded pretences of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions) but to proſecute that bleſſed King and all his Loyal Subjects, in the higheſt Degree of Cruelty and Revenge, that they could deviſe, or their ſucceſs embolden them to commit. Therefore it is a moſt neceſſary Duty of all that wiſh well to themſelves, as well as the Government, to oppoſe ſuch dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Poſitions and Practices.</p>
               <p>The Authorities I have cited in the two Chapters of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, are but the gleanings of what may be found in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men on this Subject; and ſince I ſhall have occaſion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after (when I treat of the Subjects duty) to handle this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more particularly, I ſhall be the ſhorter in this, and refer the curious Reader to the elaborate Treatiſe of Mr. <hi>Dudley Digs,</hi> Of the unlawfulneſs of Subjects taking up Arms againſt their Sovereign; and to the Glory of his Age, for Learning, Loyalty and Sanctity, the Lord Primate <hi>

               <p>In the firſt Place it ought to be conſidered, that by conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting any check upon Sovereign Princes, all Deciſions and Controverſies muſt be writ in Blood; and it would lay a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<note n="(b)" place="margin">Non tanti eſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilia bella movere.

               <p>Beſides, upon all differences betwixt the King and People,<note place="margin">No Judges can be betwixt King and People.</note> no Judge can be found to determine the Matter; and to allow this Power to the People, is to allow a Difference that can have no end, before one half of the Nation have ruined ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as by ſad Experience we found in our late Civil Wars.</p>
               <p>Further it ought to be conſidered, That this not only over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws Monarchy, but all Government; for who will obey,<note place="margin">It overthrows all Government.</note> when they can reſiſt? Under all Governments we ſhould have one Rebellion<note n="(c)" place="margin">Juſt Right of Monarchy, <hi>p.</hi> 92.93.</note> riſing out of the Aſhes of another; for only thoſe who prevailed ſhould be ſatisfied, and all the reſt would certainly conclude, that they might more juſtly oppoſe thoſe Uſurpers, than the firſt did their lawful Prince: and thus, Government (which is deſigned for the Security, Peace and Tranquillity of the State) ſhould be perpetually embroyled, and by the cruel Hoſtilities of emulous Factions, maſtering one another; the common People, and thoſe who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live peaceably, ſhould be the continual Prey of Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Harpyes and Vultures.</p>
               <p>If we allow Subjects to take Arms againſt their Prince;<note place="margin">Not allowed in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</note> we ought to allow Children the like Liberty againſt their Parents, Servants againſt their Maſters, Soldiers againſt their Officers, and the common Rabble againſt their Magiſtrates: For the King in his Sovereignty, eminently comprehends all theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
               <p>Beſides, what reaſonable Man can think (much more ought to aſſert) that it is fit to allow this Principle; when all Ages,<note place="margin">Miſchieſs of the Peoples Liberties.</note> and daily Experience teach us, That the numerous Party of Mankind is difficultly, by the moſt rational and ſtricteſt Laws, contained in their duty: What might we therefore expect, if every Man ſhould be inveſted with Power to be his own Judge, and be looſed from all Laws, and encouraged to the Duty (as it muſt be upon this Doctrine) of tranſgreſſing, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying, and breaking all Laws that eſtabliſh a Government uneaſie to him.</p>
               <p>It cannot but be obſerved, and by daily Experience is found, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in all Popular Congreſſes, in all Elections, or public Votes of the Body of the People, how violent they are, when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ſome few: How Inſolent when they find their Strength, that <hi>nos numeri ſumus:</hi> And how Cruel when enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as in the Hiſtory of Cardinal <hi>Bentivolio</hi> (to go no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) in that of <hi>Naples,</hi> under <hi>Maſianello,</hi> and that of <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> againſt the <hi>De Witts,</hi> and many more might be inſtanced in. And it will certainly be allowed, that the Multitude (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cajoled by Pretenders to be their Patriots, and the publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited maintainers of their Liberties, Properties and Religion (the uſual Shams and Wheedles, ambitious and contriving Men make of to ſeduce them) find theſe very Men more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, oppreſſive, exorbitant and Arbitrary than the worſt of Princes.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:66310:77"/>
               <p>Therefore ſince the multitude is no better qualified to judge, nor juſter when led by ſuch Chieftains: Surely all prudent Men, and Lovers of their own and their Countries Happineſs, muſt conclude it much ſafer, and conducibler to the Publick Weal, to obey thoſe whom God hath ſet over them; and the Laws, their Duties and Oaths oblige them to bear Faith and Allegiance to; than to ſubject themſelves to their fellow-Subjects, who can have no other Title but rebellious Succeſs to warrant them to haraſs, butcher, and ruin them. Whereas at the worſt in Kings, we have but an ill Maſter; but allowing Subjects to uſurp, we may fight our ſelves into ſlavery under hundreds of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and thoſe too fighting one againſt another, ſo that we ſhall not know even which of thoſe Devils to obey.</p>
               <p>Would we conſult the Hiſtories of preceding times, or our own Experiences, we ſhould find the Pretenders to reform<note n="(d)" place="margin">

They in reality neither promoting Liberty or Religion, but under that Vizard-mask, ſhrouded other black deſigns; and when they ſucceeded in their Attempts, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came infinitely more oppreſſive to the People, than the lawful Powers ever had or could be, they pretended to protect them from the Rigor of. And when<note n="(e)" place="margin">Idem, p. <hi>90, 91.</hi>
                  </note> others roſe againſt them on the ſame pretence, they did in the ſevereſt manner declare that Rebellion in others, which they contended to be lawful in themſelves. Whoever will not be convinced of this (if he by woful Experience knew it not) may read it in the Hiſtories of our late Miſeries; and if he have any Spirit of Ingenuity or Chriſtianity, will totally abandon ſuch Principles, as brought ſo waſting a Calamity on our Country.</p>
               <p>In the Conſtitution of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, we have but one Sovereign,<note place="margin">The Conſtitution of <hi>England</hi>'s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Monarchical.</note> to whom we owe Fealty, Homage, Allegiance, and Obedience by Oaths and Laws. Even all the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that acknowledg this a Monarchy, are ſo many ſolid Arguments and Teſtimonies of the Kings Supremacy; and to ſet up any co-ordinate Power whatſoever, would be to create <hi>Regnum in Regno</hi> in Temporals, as the Phanatick Principle, That <hi>Dominium fundatur in Gratia,</hi> or in <hi>Orthodoxa Religione,</hi> doth in Spirituals: Than which no Sentiment was ever invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more dangerous to overturn States, and bring all to Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>If indeed we were to form the Government, under which we were to live,<note place="margin">No new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> we might agree upon ſetting up <hi>Ephori,</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the People, <hi>Daemagogues, Calvin's</hi> Three Eſtates, or a co-ordinate Power in the two Houſes, as ſo many checks upon the Supreme Governour. But we are born under a Monarchy fix'd by Law and Conſent, time out of Mind; ſo that we may as well yield to the Levellers reducing us to the pure pute State of Nature, as the forming ſuch an <hi>Idaea</hi> of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, wherein a Sovereign is to be reſiſted, if any factious Party think themſelves aggrieved.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:66310:77"/>
               <p>It is to be well conſidered, that though <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had little or no Title of Right, yet his Conqueſt, with the Subjects ſubmiſſion, then, and in after Ages to his Succeſſors, and the Obligation of Oaths, and ſubſequent Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſupplied all Defects; and all the Limitations of that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power which accrued by Conqueſt, being the free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of himſelf and his Succeſſors (which appears in their Grants by way of Charter, as I ſhall hereafter have occaſion to enlarge upon) it is moſt evident that the King's Power is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, where no Law<note n="(f)" place="margin">
                     <hi>D. Digs</hi> Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Reſiſting.</note> can be produced to the contrary, and no ſpecial Caſe can be determined by the Subject to the Kings diſadvantage: and though the Kings ſucceeding the Conqueſt (to ſweeten Subjection,) <hi>quaedam jura pactis minuerunt,</hi> and theſe Acts of Grace were confirmed by Promiſe and Oath;<note place="margin">No Contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, whereby they may exact an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note> yet we find no Footſteps of any ſecurity given, that ſhould endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Perſon or Regal Authority, by giving to their Subjects any legal Power to unking them if they ſhould not perform Covenant. Nor could it be rational to expect ſuch; for they knew full well if they ſhould not break ſuch Promiſes, yet a Pretence that they did ſo (as we have known it was alledged concerning the Coronation Oath) might upon the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity create a Civil War.</p>
               <p>Therefore their Subjects had as little reaſon to accept, as the Kings had to offer ſo pernicious a Security, as would bring both Parties into ſuch a ſad Condition. For if Rebellion were to be allowed in any Caſe, that Caſe would be always pretended: and though the Prince were Juſt, Wiſe, and Religious; yet ambitious Men (to compaſs their own Ends) would impute to him Oppreſſion, Weakneſs, or Irreligion, as the World knows by too ſad Experience was verified in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr; who taking his meaſures of others Sincerity, by the rule of his own Heart, ſuffered pretences of publick Good to grow up to inſolent Tumults, and at laſt to Rebellion; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Exemplary Practice in his publick Devotions, was traduced to have but handſomly diſſembled, and favoured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Religion in his Heart; and at laſt brought before a crew of Regicides, impeached of breach of Truſt, Tyranny, and I know not how many horrid Crimes againſt his Subjects; who yet died the Peoples Martyr, and the Royal Aſſerter of their Liberties and Priviledges, which all his Subjects found to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with him; the greateſt Arbitrarineſs and cruelleſt Tyranny, being, during their Power, exerciſed by the new Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth Men, that ever was read of in any Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who read Books, among thoſe of the Sect of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines in Politicks, and ſo much magnify the great name of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Subject and co-ordinate Powers,<note place="margin">Writers who lived under Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, no Guides to us.</note> converſe moſt in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors, who lived under Commonwealths, and ſo were profuſe in the commendation of their Country Government, againſt Uſurpers; or elſe theſe admired Authors were<note n="(g)" place="margin">Jus Regium, p. <hi>134.</hi>

For whereas they ſay that the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance is the readieſt Motive to eſtabliſh Tyranny: It is much more certain and experimentally known that the Leaders of the Rabble al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prove ſuch, and that the Diſtractions of a civil War (which ordinarily are occaſioned by the pretence of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething amiſs in the Governours, and Competitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Perſons for Soveraignty) deſtroy more than the Luſts of any one Tyrant can do; which made <hi>Lucan,</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican, and of the <hi>Pompeian</hi> Party, conclude, after a ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the continual Civil Wars betwixt <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius, Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> without touching upon what followed under the Triumvirs,
<q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And if he preferred even the Tyranny or abſoluteneſs of thoſe Kings, before the State of Civil Wars; how much more have we reaſon to ſubmit, and that chearfully, to the moſt eaſy Yoak of the Sovereignty of our Princes. We need not be ſolicitous, that their unaccountableneſs to their Subjects ſhall prompt them to Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, becauſe we have good Security (as ſtrong as humane Wiſdom ever invented) that we ſhall live happily under that Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which our Fore-fathers enjoyed the Benefit of in an high Degree,<note place="margin">The Security we have, that no Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government can be exerciſed in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> never diſtruſting the ſound temper of the Policy.</p>
               <p>For firſt our Kings ſwear at their Coronations to preſerve the Laws, Liberties, Properties and Religion. Secondly, If they ſhould command illegal things, the Executors of them are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible to Parliamentary Inquiſitions. Laſtly, the Intereſt of the King is the ſame with that of the Subject, as to their Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Miſery; ſo that a King will always conſult the good of his Subjects: which made<note n="(h)" place="margin">Praeeſtis homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, ſed hominum cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, nec domini modo &amp; Arbitri rerum, ſed Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores &amp; Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores eſtis.

               <p>To conclude this diſcourſe, We have heard of, or ſeen, the ſad Calamities the Republican Rebellion brought upon all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Dominions, when the mild Government of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt was altered to the moſt Bloody and Tyrannical one of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:66310:78"/>his rebellious Subjects that any Age could parallel; and we have had Experience of the merciful Government of his Royal Son and Succeſſor, and have lived to ſee all the Eſtabliſhments of Uſurpers brought to Confuſion.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen a formidable Rebellion burſt forth in our Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous King <hi>James</hi> the Second's Reign (which had been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeven Years before) utterly overthrown in two Months; and we cannot peruſe Hiſtories, but we muſt meet with infinite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the ſad devaſtations ſuch Rebellions bring to their Country, and the unſucceſsfulneſs of them. Therefore I would earneſtly adviſe all Malecontents, never to make their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's Ruine, and the ſlain Carcaſſes of their Countrymen, the Steps by which they muſt aſcend the Scaffolds, or the Rounds of the Ladders they muſt mount the Gallows, which, without a Prince's Clemency, are the ſure Rewards of all Rebels, and their certain Fate.</p>

               <p>To which it may replied, according to<note n="(d)" place="margin">King's Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>p.</hi> 89.</note> Mr. <hi>Sheringham,</hi> That though it be granted, that they have an Enacting Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this particular of Law-making, (which how ſtep by ſtep it hath been brought to the ſtate it is now in, will be cleared in the following Chapters) yet the Queſtion is, firſt, Whether that be only a Power of aſſenting, that ſuch or ſuch a Law ſhall be eſtabliſhed; or a Power that commandeth and giveth life and vigour to the Laws? Secondly, Whether the Power be radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in themſelves, or derived from the King?</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, It is agreed by the Judges,<note n="(e)" place="margin">
                     <hi>2</hi> H. <hi>7.14.11</hi> H. <hi>7.25.</hi> Lambard Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheion, fol. <hi>271.</hi>
                  </note> That the Words <hi>Aſſenteth</hi> and <hi>Enacteth</hi> are equivalent in this Caſe: For their Power of preparing Materials for a Law, by framing Bills, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently denotes their Aſſent, becauſe they are Bills of their own framing; and the Wiſdom they ſhow in theſe, and the Care of the Government and People, will always make that Auguſt Body of great uſe to the Government, and valuable by their Fellow-ſubjects.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly,<note place="margin">In this Particular the Writ of Summons is that which gives them all the Power, of which in the Chapter of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large.</note> It muſt be conſidered from whom they have this Authority. They have the Uſe and Exerciſe of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power, ſo far as is neceſſary for that Act, although it be not radically in them: for although the King's Authority cannot be ſeparated from him <hi>privativè,</hi> ſo as to deprive him of it; yet <hi>cumulativè</hi> it may be inherent in his own Perſon, and yet be in others too; as the Light of the Sun is inherent in its own Body, and yet diffuſed through the whole World: And ſo we call it Moon-ſhine, and Star-light, when all their Lights are from the Sun. And this Delegate Authority may be called theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for the time of their Sitting they are by the Sovereign and Conſtitution of Government ſo capacitated to act: But ſince they are called by the King's Writ, and diſſolved at his Pleaſure, they cannot be ſaid to have the Power radically in themſelves.</p>
               <p>If this radical Power in the Two Houſes were true, How could the<note n="(f)" place="margin">24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 1 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> Statutes declare the King to have entire, whole, and plenary Power, and to be ſo Supreme, that all Authority is derived from him, and all Obedience and Allegiance due to him, and him alone? An utmoſt Chiefty and Primity of Share (as they uſed to ſpeak in 1641.) will not make out the Force of the Statutes.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the Kings of <hi>England</hi> deſiring to rule their People by Lenity, have out of Princely Clemency condeſcended ſo far, as not to impoſe upon them (as hereafter it will appear
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66310:84"/>they anciently did) any new Law, or alter and repeal the old, without their own Conſents, by their Repreſentatives: The Black Parliament of 1641. would have the People believe,<note place="margin">The Encroachments of the Black Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that their Authority was equal with the Kings: But when Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had. hardned them, they were not content with a ſhare, they at firſt challenged, but laid claim to all; wholly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the King, and denying him his Negative Voice; uſurping and taking upon them the whole Power of making Laws: So that this Serpent of Co-ordinate Power is not to be ſuffered to wrigle in its Head, leſt the whole Body glide eaſily after.</p>
               <p>But I leave the further diſcourſe of this to its proper Place,<note place="margin">Preface to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapters.</note> and ſhall now proceed to give ſome Light to the Government the <hi>Britans</hi> had among them, by the Compariſon is found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Germans:</hi> Being deſirous, as much as I can, to ſhow the Ancienteſt uſages, and under the ſeveral Conqueſts of <hi>England;</hi> how the Government hath received Growth and Alteration (ſometimes the People being under the Slavery of abſolute Conquerors, and other times factious No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles bearding their Kings) how the even Thred of Regular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment hath been carried on or interrupted; how from an abſolute Power of giving Law, and ruling in a Military way, by the Feudal Law, and many other particulars, the Government is brought to that Temperament, whereby the Subjects may, if they will be dutiful, live happilier than any other do.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate all theſe, it will be neceſſary to repreſent the State of the <hi>Britans</hi> under the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to diſcourſe of the <hi>Germans,</hi> from whence our <hi>Saxon</hi> Anceſtors came; and of both of their Manners and Laws, and from thence to proceed to illuſtrate the Legiſlative Power: In all which, if I carry my Reader out of his Country, to view the State of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Neighbours; I hope he will think it no ill ſpent time, to make that pleaſing as well as profitable towr: And though I repreſent him his Anceſtors rude and barbarous in Compariſon of the <hi>Roman</hi> civilizedneſs; yet he will find they had ſome Religion, ſome Arts, great and generous Souls, as well as ſtrong Bodies; and their greateſt miſ-hap ſeems to be, that thoſe in <hi>Britan, Gaul</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> were not under one Monarchy,<note place="margin">Nec aliud adverſus validiſſimas Gentes pro nobis utilius quam quod in commune non conſulunt. <hi>Vita Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colae, p. 308.</hi>

               <p>When I read theſe Aſſertions, I think it had been incumbent upon theſe learned Men to have deduced (as far as they could by Hiſtory) ſome Teſtimonies of Ancient Writers, to have confirmed their Poſitions: But in none of them do we find the leaſt offer of a Proof for what they ſay.</p>
               <p>I think it would be a very commendable Work, and very pleaſant to all ingenious Perſons;<note place="margin">The Benefit to have our Common Laws and Cuſtoms aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with all Ancient Laws.</note> if ſome of the Long Robe would digeſt into Heads, that which is owned as the Common Law. For though Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> calls it unwritten, and which had its beginning beyond the Memory of any Man living; and that a Cuſtom tryed and approved, time out of mind, doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Law to bind the People; yet nothing can hinder, but whatever is preſerved in the Memory of Men living, and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as cuſtom, may be committed to writing: Now I would not only deſire it might be ſo written and publiſhed, but that ſome judicious Lawyer (who was likewiſe well verſed in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory and Antiquities) would ſearch out for ſome parallel writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Laws among the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> as alſo compare all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws we have, the Laws of the <hi>Lombards, Boiarian, Ripuarian,</hi> and other Laws, and then I doubt not but they would acquire a greater Veneration in the World; and it would be known whether the Opinions of the learned Chancellor and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66310:85"/>Lord Chief Juſtice, were to be relied upon as to the Antiquity of them before the <hi>Roman</hi> time.</p>
               <p>The Glory of his Profeſſion, and of our Nation (as to that learning he was verſed in, which was not ſmall) I mean<note n="(e)" place="margin">Notes upon <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſcue, p.</hi> 14. <hi>ad</hi> 22.</note> Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> hath given the beſt Solution to this point of the Antiquity of our Cuſtoms and Common Law, that I have yet met with; which I ſhall abſtract in as ſummary a way as I can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> he ſaith, The Opinion of the Antiquity of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, before the Civil, is founded upon the Story of <hi>Brute</hi> (of which the Chancellor ſpeaks in his Thirteenth Chapter) and that Story ſuppoſing him to be here more than three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years before <hi>Rome</hi> was built, makes the Chancellor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our Common Law ſo Ancient; but ſuppoſing there were ſome Truth in that Fiction, how can the Chancellor be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the ſame kind of Law and Policy hath ever ſince continued; unleſs an Oral Tradition may here find as great reſpect, as it hath with ſome in ſpiritual matters.<note place="margin">The Antiquity of all Laws.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore with Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> we may judge all Laws in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, originally to be equally Ancient, as being grounded upon Nature, every Nation taking the grounds of their Laws from it; and Nature being the ſame in all, the beginning of all Laws muſt be the ſame: Even from the firſt Peopling of the Land, when Men (by Nature, being civil and ſociable Creatures) grew to plant common Society and, I may add, when they being under the Government of a Prince, received Laws by his Appointment, extracted out of the Laws of Nature, the Neceſſity of Government, and the Conveniences of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we may date National Laws. Now though the Law of Nature be truly ſaid to be immutable, yet it's as true, that it's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable, and the limited Law of Nature is that now uſed in every State; for the divers Opinions of Interpreters, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the weakneſs of Mans Reaſon, and the ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of divers States, have made thoſe different Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the Law of Nature hath ſuffered: It falls out, that in ſeveral Nations they are ſo diſguiſed by the various Modifyings and Repairs, that as to their firſt being, they are like<note n="(f)" place="margin">Vbi nihil ex pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina materia ſuperſit.</note> 
                  <hi>Jaſon</hi>'s Ship, that had nothing of the old Materials remaining.</p>
               <p>Therefore the learned <hi>Selden</hi> adds, That little follows in point of Honour or Excellency, ſpecially to be attributed to the Laws of a Nation in general, by any Argument drawn from the difference of Antiquity, which in ſubſtance is alike in all: for as ſoon as <hi>Italy</hi> was peopled, this beginning of Laws was there; and ſo when there was firſt a State in that Land which the Common Law now governs, there were natural Laws limited for the Convenience of civil Society here.</p>

               <p>Having thus far given ſome ſhort hints of the Government of the <hi>Britans,</hi> by comparing them with the manner of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> as ſuppoſing it might be made out from good Authority, that there was a great Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Forms of Government: I come now more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to prove, that where the <hi>Romans</hi> conquered, they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed their own Laws; and that the unwritten Laws and Cuſtoms muſt be of little force, during the Peoples Subjection to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and ſo by ſome Hundred of years diſuſe, were like to be ſo far forgotten, as it cannot be ſaid (as Chancellor <hi>Forteſcue</hi> doth) that during the <hi>Britans, Romans, Saxons, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> the Realm hath been ruled with the ſelf ſame Cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore we may conſider, That the <hi>Druids</hi> (who if they had not the Law-making Power, yet were the ſole Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and decided all Controverſies) being ſo wholly aboliſhed; and we finding no account of the Laws they judged by, we may well conclude, That the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Laws (whatever they

               <p>To which I ſhall only give Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s anſwer in his <hi>Gloſſary,</hi> That it is true that King <hi>Alfred</hi> did write the <hi>Mercian</hi> Laws into his own <hi>Weſt Saxon</hi> Laws; but (as appears by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his Laws) that he collected what ever he found in the Laws of King <hi>Ina</hi> his Countryman, <hi>Offa</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> or <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> who was firſt baptized; and thoſe that were juſt, he collected, others being rejected. It is not probable that <hi>Offa</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> King, the cruelleſt Enemy to the <hi>Britains,</hi> having driven them out of all the Confines of his Kingdom into <hi>Wales,</hi> ſhould carry back their Laws as his Spoils; eſpecially the Laws being ſo wicked, that in the next Age they ſhould be expunged, and juſter Laws be choſen, as we ſee in the Preface to thoſe of <hi>Hoel Dha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall offer but one Argument more, and ſo conclude with Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s opinion: When <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> made his Laws <hi>Anno</hi> 613. as in the next Chapter I ſhall relate; <hi>Bede</hi> ſaith, he framed them after the <hi>Roman</hi> Example, after <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana Biſena;</hi> by which we may underſtand, either according to the Laws then uſed by the Civil or Eccleſiaſtic State of the <hi>Romans.</hi>

               <p>As to their publick Conſultations, <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerves further, That of leſſer matters (ſuch as I ſuppoſe concerned not the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick State of Affairs in War or Peace, but the particular order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matters of their private Juriſdictions) the Princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult: about greater buſineſs all, yet ſo as thoſe things, of which the loweſt ſort of the People are Judges, are firſt treated of by the Princes. By which I underſtand, <hi>Tacitus</hi> means by greater matters, the Conſultations about the defending themſelves againſt their Enemies, eſpecially againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> where the unanimous ſuffrage of the greateſt multitude was requiſite.</p>
               <p>By all which, it is apparent that there were ſeveral Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in <hi>Germany,</hi> and that the Souldiery made up a great part of the People: and where we read of ſuffrages, it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of theirs; and whatever freedom of Votes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we read of, was principally in debating Military Affairs: and that <hi>Germany</hi> doth yet retain free Princes, and free Cities, though

So he. Now this Fealty and Homage is now held no kind of Slavery, but then it was, as I have elſewhere noted.

               <p>Let us now return to the <hi>Exchequer</hi>-book, where we find, That when a common miſerable Complaint of the Natives came to the King, that they thus expoſed and ſpoiled of all things, ſhould be compelled to paſs into other Countries: At length, after Conſultation upon theſe things, it was decreed, That what they could by their deſerts and lawful Bargain, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from their Lords,<note place="margin">The <hi>Engliſh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with their Lords.</note> they ſhould hold by unviolable Right; but ſhould not claim any thing from the time the Nation was conquered, under the Title of Succeſſion or Deſcent.

               <p>In which we may obſerve,<note place="margin">The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have little Benefit by his Relaxation of the Feudal Law.</note> that this was no <hi>Magna Charta</hi> made to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men; theſe <hi>liberi Homines</hi> were ſuch as held in Military Service, as appears by the 58th.

So that even ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels owned Kings the Fountains, Authors, and Eſtabliſhers of their Liberties, as well knowing they were born Subjects, and whatever was remitted of the abſolute Power of Princes, was by their own Grants; though they might be induced to thoſe Conceſſions from ſeveral cauſes, but whenever threats, force, or other neceſſities for ſupplies, or ſuch like, extorted theſe, they were very ill kept. <hi>Anno</hi> 1215. 17 <hi>Joh.</hi> the Barons preſſing the King to confirm the Charter of Priviledges, the Archbiſhop with his Aſſociates read over each Chapter.

                  <p>Whereas at our Parliament, ſummoned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the <hi>Quindene</hi> of <hi>Eaſter</hi> laſt paſt, certain Articles, expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws and Cuſtoms of our Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and to our Prerogatives, and Rights Royal, were pretended to be granted by us in the manner of a Statute. And conſidering, how by the Bond of our Oath we be tied to the obſervance and defence of ſuch Laws, Cuſtoms, Rights, and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and providently willing to revoke ſuch things to their own State which be ſo improvidently done. Upon Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Treatiſe thereupon, with the Earls, Barons and other Wiſe Men of our ſaid Realm; and becauſe we never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the making of the ſaid Statute, but as it then behoved
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66310:123"/>us, we diſſimuled in the Premiſſes, by Proteſtations of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the ſaid Statute, if indeed it ſhould proceed, to eſchew the danger, which by denying the ſame we feared to come, for as much as the ſaid Parliament otherwiſe had been, without diſpatching any thing, in diſcord diſſolved, and ſo our earneſt buſineſs had likely been ruinated, which God prohibit, and the ſaid pretended Statute we promiſed then to have ſealed.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemed to the ſaid Earls, Barons, and other Wiſe Men, that ſithence the Statute did not of our Free Will proceed, the ſame be void, and ought not to have the name or ſtrength of a Statute, and therefore by their counſel and aſſent we have decreed the ſaid Statute to be void, and the ſame as much as it proceeded of Dread we have agreed to be adnulled.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, that the Articles contained in the ſaid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Statute, which by other of our Statutes, or of our Progenitors Kings of <hi>England,</hi> have been approved, ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the form of the ſaid Statute, in every point, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient is, be obſerved, and the ſame we do only for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Redintegration of the Rights of our Crown, as we be bound, and not that we ſhould in any wiſe grieve or oppreſs our Subjects, whom we deſire to rule in lenity and gentleneſs.

                  <p>All the other Acts which are not Grants of Aid, Aſſiſtance, or Supply, are conceived in the latter words.</p>
                  <p>By this full enumeration of the moſt conſiderable Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either of Records or Hiſtorians, relating to the Great Councils or Parliaments from <hi>William the Conqueror's</hi> time to this preſent Age, (which in a continued ſeries of time I have deduced, it appears, that till King <hi>John</hi>'s time, only the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Earls, and Barons, and ſuch of the great Tenents <hi>in Capite</hi> as were not Barons, were ſummoned, and at the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by ſpecial Writ; and after King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Tenents <hi>in Capite</hi> by General Summons. Alſo, that the Charters of Kings wherein they granted Liberties to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were received as Laws, and gave as ample Satisfaction as now <hi>The King willeth,</hi> doth to paſs a Bill tendred for his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Aſſent by both Houſes; and there was good reaſon, becauſe it paſſed under his Broad Seal.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe, when the Conſtitution of Parliament was altered, 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. whereby in place of the Tenents <hi>in Capite,</hi> which were numerous, two Knights were choſen, probably by the reſt of the Tenents <hi>in Capite</hi> for the Shires, and two Citizens, and two Burgeſſes for Burroughs, to repreſent all thoſe that held <hi>in Capite,</hi> and it is likely all other their Subfeudatary Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents; yet the number was not conſtantly obſerved, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes Knights, and no Citizens or Burgeſſes, ſometimes one Knight, one Citizen, and one Burgeſs, other times two or three Knights, left as it ſeems to the Sheriffs, or the Chuſers Election, till after it was fixed as it now is, for two Knights, two Citizens, and two Burgeſſes, unleſs in ſome places of <hi>Wales,</hi> where to this Day, ſome two or three Burroughs chuſe but one or two Burgeſſes.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe it is worth the obſerving how gradually the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Aſſent hath paſs'd from the Advice of the Biſhops and Nobles to the Aſſent likewiſe, and ſometimes at their requeſt, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King ordains; and then from the Potition of the Commons to their joyning in Advice, and after to their Aſſent, and many other material progreſſive alterations, which in this recapitulation I cannot inſiſt upon, till it hath come to that conſtitution ſo much to be valued by all wiſe <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> as it is the product of the generous condeſcenſions of Gracious Kings, and the wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of our conſiderate Anceſtors.

Secondly, It appears in ancient times, there was no ſuch ambition to be Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:66310:142"/>as of late, but the Perſons elected thought it a burthen; therefore leſt being elected they ſhould neglect to repair to the Convention, they had Sureties called Manucaptors for their Appearance. Thirdly, This obliged the Counties, Cities and Burroughs to be carefuller in electing the diſcreeteſt, ableſt, fitteſt and moſt laborious perſons, who would ſpeedieſt and beſt diſpatch all Public buſineſs, which occaſioned the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Seſſions. Fourthly, It begat a greater confidence, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence and dependance betwixt the Electors and Elected. Fifthly, It kept poor petty Burroughs (unable to defray the Expences of their Burgeſſes) from electing or ſending Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to our Parliaments, and oblig'd ſome to Petition to be eaſed of the Charge; whereby the number of Burgeſſes was ſcarce half ſo many, and Parliaments were more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in Councils, Aids, Motions and their Acts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and ſo the Seſſions were much ſhortned, the Elections were then fairer, and for the moſt part unqueſtionable, the Commons Houſe leſs unwieldy, Privileges of Parliament leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged beyond the ancient Standard, abuſes in Elections, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns and Conteſts about them (by reaſon of the Mercenary and Precarious Voices) leſs troubleſom: whereas now in every new Parliament a great part of the time is ſpent in the regulating Elections. But Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hints little upon one great cauſe of that uſage, which was that in Burroughs as well as Cities, moſt what the perſons elected were the Inhabitants in the Cities and Burroughs, Merchants, Tradeſmen, or the moſt popular Burghers; as will appear to whoever peruſeth the Chronologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Catalogue Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Some ſummoned from Cities and Burroughs before King <hi>John</hi>'s time, but not as our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens and Burgeſſes now, by Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> and the Inhabitants <hi>Burgenſes,</hi> who held a certain Land cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Burgage</hi> Land) and the Barons of the Cinque Ports, and all the Ports ſhould have all their Liberties and their Free Cuſtoms, <hi>&amp; ad habendum commune concilium Regni de Auxiliis, &amp;c.</hi> that is as I ſuppoſe, to have ſome of their Members at the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, where Aids were to be granted to the King, other ways than in three caſes before excepted, that is, to redeem the Kings body, to make his Eldeſt Son a Knight, and to marry once his Eldeſt Daughter; excepting which three Particulars (reſerved before) in his Charter, he had granted that no Scutage nor Aid ſhould be laid on his Kingdom unleſs by the Common Council of his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>From whence I think may be inferred, that ſuch Cities, Burroughs and Villa's, which held <hi>in Capite,</hi> or the Lord that was principal owner of them, by his <hi>Praepoſitus Ballivus,</hi> or ſome that held immediately under him, and ſo ſome for the <hi>Dominicae Civitates &amp; Burgi Regis,</hi> might be ſummoned, with the leſſer Barons, or the other Tenents <hi>inc Capite.</hi> But this doth not prove them to come by way of Repreſentatives, nor that they had any more Power than the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes had in after-times, which (as I have made it apparent by the ſeveral expreſſions in the Summons) was only to hear, and aſſent to what the King and <hi>Magnates</hi> ordained.</p>
                  <p>Since there are now extant no Summons in King <hi>John</hi>'s time, or before the 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. (except ſome few that are about the Tenents <hi>in Capite</hi> aiding the King in his Wars) the ſubſequent Practices are the beſt Expounders of ancient Uſages.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole I do judge, that before King <hi>John</hi>'s Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there were many of the Tenents <hi>in Capite</hi> ſummoned to the great Councils, but ſo as the King had his liberty to ſummon whom he pleaſed; and that ſome from Cities, Burghs, Villa's and other Ports did come to the great Council, but ſtill at the Kings pleaſure, and that in <hi>King John</hi>'s time, the body of the Kingdom ſiding with the Lords (that ſo often rebelled againſt him) the Lords thinking to make their Party ſtronger, got the Clauſe for other Tenents <hi>in Capite</hi> to be ſummoned by general Summons.<note place="margin">After King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents <hi>in Capite</hi> ſo numerous, as might be reputed an Houſe of Commons.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whatever number were convened, before King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, this general Summons muſt greatly encreaſe the Houſe of Commons, as I may call it; and there needs no ſuch ſtrife
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66310:145"/>about the want of Freemen in theſe Councils; for after this Charter all who were properly Freemen, were capable, the other were generally Tenents to them, and Homagers, (which was a Tenure that though it might free their Perſons, yet their Lands were obnoxious to forfeiture upon every breach of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; and their Lords had the power of taxing them) ſo that in ſome ſenſe they were their Tenents Repreſentatives: and as long as they were Freeholders themſelves, and were a more numerous body (if they all appeared, as for any thing I ſee they might do, if not hindred by Impotence, Nonage, or the Kings ſervice) they far exceeded the number of Repreſentatives in the Reigns of King <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>E.</hi> 1. and <hi>E.</hi> 2.

                  <p>It cannot be conceived in ſo great a Body as the Houſe of Commons,<note place="margin">Why Liberty of Speech neceſſary to be allowed.</note> that what is propoſed by one, and ſeconded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhall not admit of Debate: Though all may aim at the ſame end, the good of the King and People; yet they may differ in the ways and methods of attaining it, and whoever would ſtraighten a crooked Rod, muſt bend it as far on the contrary ſide.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:66310:147"/>drawn by them. The Queen was highly diſpleaſed, as being againſt her expreſs Order, and charged the Lords of her Council to call the parties before them, and Mr. <hi>Wentworth</hi> was by them committed to the Tower, and others, with Sir <hi>Hen. Bromley</hi> to the Fleet; the Parliament then ſitting: and when Mr. <hi>Wroth</hi> moved, That the Houſe might be humble Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the Queen for their Liberty, it was anſwered by the Privy Counſellors in the Houſe, that the cauſes of Commitment were beſt known to her ſelf, and the Houſe muſt not call the Queen to account for what ſhe doth of her Royal Authority; for her Majeſty liked no ſuch Queſtions, neither did it become the Houſe to ſearch into thoſe matters. So Mr.<note place="margin">In Mr. <hi>Morrice</hi>'s Caſe.</note>

                  <p>At another time, long before this, ſhe told the Speaker, and the body of the Houſe of Commons, moving her to Marriage, That if it had been with limitation of place, or perſon, ſhe muſt needs have miſliked it, and thought it a great preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in thoſe to take it upon them to bind and limit, whoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it was to Obey.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt was very infortunate to have ſo many Firebrands in ſome, if not all, of his Parliaments;<note place="margin">Liberty of Speech in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's time abuſed.</note> which if the reſt of the Houſes had been pleaſed to have extinguiſhed by timely and nipping reprehenſions, we had never ſeen the Government of Church and State ſo reduced into Aſhes, that there was nothing remained of the beautiful Pile. In ſome of his Speeches he calls thoſe evil Members, <hi>Vipers;</hi> but it was his misfortune to anger and exaſperate them rather than ſuppreſs them; ſo that at laſt, they ſtung him to Death. It is a very ill condition, when a Prince hath ſuch Wolves by the Ears, that he is in danger whether he hold them or let them go. The At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque upon the five Members, and letting fall the purſuit, was one of the falſe thruſts that left him unguarded.</p>

                  <p>Indeed there ſeems good reaſon, that ſuch, who make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their being Members of Parliament, to ſow their Seditious Diſcourſes; and under the Protection of being Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, take the boldneſs to calumniate the Government, and

                  <p>It becomes therefore all lovers of the excellent Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Parliaments to be very wary in this point, leſt, as Mr. Juſtice <hi>Hutton</hi> ſaid in another Caſe, Things being carried diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly by ſome Members Ambition, may bring ſuch a diſtaſt againſt the courſe of Parliaments, as we, and all that love the Commonwealth, have juſt cauſe to be ſorry for it.</p>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:66310:149"/>off in defending the Serjeant. This being declared to the Houſe (of whom there were not a few, as well of the Kings Privy Council, as alſo of his Privy Chamber) they would ſit no longer without their Burgeſs, but retired to the Upper Houſe, where the whole Caſe was declared by Sir <hi>Thomas Moile</hi> their Speaker, before Sir <hi>Thomas Audley</hi> Lord Chancellor; and all the Lords and Judges there aſſembled, judging the contempt to be very great, referred the puniſhment thereof to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Commons Houſe.

                  <p>From this memorable Petition Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> makes many obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; the principal of which are, that the King himſelf was to redreſs and rectify all falſe and undue Returns. Secondly, That this is the only clear Declaration and Record, he hath met with, complaining againſt a Sheriff giving of an Oath,<note place="margin">A Sheriffs denying the Poll, petitioned againſt.</note> and Poll to ſome Freeholders, and denying it to others. Thirdly, That when legal Electors cannot be ſworn or polled, without breach of the Peace, or Manſlaughter; they may juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and ought to make ſuch a complaint and declaration, under their hands and Seals. Fourthly, That Ignoble perſons, who are not of Gentile birth, ought not to be elected Knights of Shires.

The conſequences of all which are too well known to the whole Kingdom, whoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of Civil War, and all the unſpeakable Tragedies of it, flowed from the packing of Members in the Commons Houſe, and the Aſſiſtance the People (relying upon their Sageneſs, and Authority) afforded them.<note place="margin">How this revived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Abhorrers.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We had of later Years a freſh revival of the ſame method in the Houſe of Commons, expelling thoſe they called Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: which is ſo well known, that I need ſay nothing of it; yet I would recommend to all intereſſed Perſons, the peruſal of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:66310:152"/>two Treatiſes, which though they paſs for Pamphlets, yet have been writ by Judicious Authors, and thoſe are, <hi>The Lawyer outlawed,</hi> and the <hi>Three parts of the Addreſſes,</hi> which are Books very fit for Gentlemen to peruſe.</p>
                  <p>How full and unqueſtioned a power the Commons have to repreſent Grievances to the King, and petition for Redreſs;<note place="margin">The unqueſtioned Rights of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> to impeach any Perſon of the higheſt Quality that is a Subject, for Treaſon, or high Miſdemeanors; to have the ſole Power in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all Bills, for Subſidies, Aids and Supplies, to begin, and, I think, be perfected in their Houſe; and the Privileges they peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for by their Speaker] are ſo well known, that they need no Diſcourſe upon.</p>
                  <p>But I find ſeveral Judicious Perſons will not allow the Houſe of Commons to be a Court; which Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> affirms,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Inſtit. p.</hi> 28.

Therefore the Words of the Statute are, That the Speakers Licence for Members going into the Country, be entred of Record, in the Book of the Clerk of the Parliament, appointed for the Commons Houſe: and this Journal is rather a Regiſter of what paſſeth, than ſuch a Record as denotes a Court of Judicature, as the Author of <hi>The Lawyer outlawed</hi> endeavours to prove;<note place="margin">P. <hi>17, 18, 19.</hi> Plowd.

Alſo there is no Court without a power of tryal; but the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons have no power to try any Crime or Offence, becauſe they cannot examine upon Oath: and there can be no legal Tryal without Witneſſes, nor are any Witneſſes of any force in Law, unleſs examined upon Oath.</p>

                  <p>How agreeable theſe ways of Proceedings were to the Uſage of the Houſe of Commons in 1640. and 1680.<note place="margin">The Proceeding of the Houſes in <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. and 1680.</note> are freſh in every ones memory, when not only they ejected and impriſoned their own Members, but by Meſſengers ſent for ſeveral Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and others, no Members, for acting according to the known Laws, and King's Proclamations; and often for Perſons having ſpoke angrily or ſlightingly of ſome Member, as in the Caſe of Abhorrers.</p>
                  <p>It is to be hoped thoſe very Gentlemen now wiſh it might be forgot, as I hope it will never be put in practice again; when, after a chargeable ſending for up by the terrible Meſſengers, after being detained in Cuſtody during the Pleaſure of the Houſe, and brought to receive their Sentence on their Knees at the Houſe of Commons Bar, they were diſmiſſed: So that I knew one who principally to avoid the Charge (his Crime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſpeaking Words againſt a Member, in his Cups) was forced, upon notice of the Meſſenger's coming for him, to fly into <hi>Ireland.</hi>

The Debate laſted three days, by reaſon of the Difficulty of the Cauſe: For if they openly declared againſt the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> the Nation would be much alarm'd, and ſuſpect theſe Gentlemen, inſtead of ſecuring, intended to invade the Subjects Liberties; but if they allowed the Writ, the delicious Power of Impriſoning ſuch as they had a Pique to, was utterly loſt, and all Perſons referred to the ordinary Courts of Juſtice, or, upon their failure, to the Houſe of Lords,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any ones Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe by <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> if they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned by the Houſe of Commons.</note> the Supreme Tribunal of <hi>England.</hi>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:66310:154"/>Sir <hi>William</hi> perſiſted, urging,<note place="margin">See Debates of the Houſe, <hi>p.</hi> 217.</note> That whatever Reaſons may be given for diſcharging ſuch as are not committed for Breach of Privilege, (if grounded on the Act for the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>) will hold as ſtrong for diſcharging of Perſons for Breach of Privilege, and ſo conſequently deprive the Houſe of all its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Dignity, and ſo make it inſignificant; and ſaid, That was ſo plain and obvious, that all the Judges ought to take notice of it: and ſo judged it below the Houſe to make any Reſolution therein, but rather to leave the Judges to do otherwiſe at their peril, and let the Debate fall without any Queſtion.

                     </note> That Privileges may be loſt by the abuſe of the Power; and that whatever Privilege the Houſe hath, is from the King's Grant, or Toleration. Therefore, according to the Canoniſts Rule, If the Privilege granted be expreſſed in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, dubious, or obſcure Words, then it is in the power of him to interpret, who hath the power to grant. Now the Petition of the Speaker is, That the Commons in this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may, and ſhall have all their Ancient and Juſt Privileges allowed them. Therefore the King,<note place="margin">Nemini liceat Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Regias niſi ipſis Regibus judicare. Placita Parl. <hi>18</hi> E. <hi>1.</hi> num. <hi>19.</hi> p. <hi>20.</hi>
                     </note> being the ſole Granter of theſe Privileges, muſt be the only proper Interpreter and Judge of them, as he is of all his other Charters of Privileges, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, Franchiſes, and Acts of Parliament themſelves, after his Regal Aſſent thereto; not the Commons, or Perſons to whom they are granted; and that both in and out of Parliament, by Advice of his Nobles, or Judges of the Common-Law.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he ſaith, firſt,<note place="margin">How the Breach of Privilege to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, according to Mr. <hi>Prynne.</hi> See the Authority, Brief Regiſt. <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 847.</note> That if the Commons by Petition to the King and Lords in Parliament, complain of the Breach of their ancient Privileges and Liberties, as they ever did in the Caſes of <hi>Lark, Thorp, Hyde, Clerk, Atwyll,</hi> and others; the King, by Advice of his Lords in Parliament, aſſiſted with his Judges, hath been, and (as he humbly conceives) is the ſole proper Judge of them and their violations; not the Commons, who being Parties, Proſecutors, and Complainants, are no legal indifferent Judges in their own or Menial Servants caſes, if they will avoid partiality, which is the reaſon the Law allows Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges to Jurors in Civil and Criminal cauſes.

                  <p>I Have treated ſo much of this elſewhere, as to the ſole Power in the King, the ancient Cuſtom of Sealing the Acts with the Kings Seal, and of ſome of the Prelates and Nobles, as Witneſſes of their Aſſents; that I ſhall only now ſpeak as to the uſual formality of paſſing the Bills into Acts by the Kings laſt Act.<note place="margin">See alſo his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.</note> For Mr. <hi>Hackwell</hi> hath given a full account of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how Statutes are enacted in Parliament by paſſing of Bills; to which Book I refer the curious Reader that would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the order that is uſed in the debating and paſſing of them.</p>

                  <p>The Royal Aſſent is uſually deferred to the laſt day of the Seſſion: and becauſe ſome have been of opinion, that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Bills,<note place="margin">The Royal Aſſent determines not the Seſſion.</note> puts an end to the Seſſions, ſo that what ever Bills are ready, and paſs not the Royal Aſſent, muſt be again read three times in either Houſe; for the more ſecurity, it is uſual to inſert a Proviſo, That the Seſſion is not thereby concluded.</p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:66310:155"/>
                  <p>The Royal Aſſent is given two ways: Firſt,<note place="margin">Royal Aſſent by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note> by Commiſſion ſince the Statute of the 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 21. wherein it is expreſſed, That the Kings Royal Aſſent by his Letters Patents under the Great Seal, Signed by his hand, and declared and notified in his abſence to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and to the Commons Aſſembled in the higher Houſe; is and ever was of as good ſtrengh and force, as if the King had been there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally preſent, and aſſented openly and publickly to the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The manner of the King's giving his Publick Aſſent is in this manner. The King cometh in Perſon, in his Parliament-Robes,<note place="margin">Royal Aſſent when the King preſent.</note> and ſitteth in his State, and the Upper Houſe ſit in their Robes: The Speaker, with all the Commons Houſe, cometh to the Bar of the Lords Houſe; and in Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi>'s time,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Th.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> Of Factious Combinations in Parliaments.</head>
               <p>I Hope in the foregoing Chapters, I have ſo explained the Conſtitution of Parliaments, and the Legiſlative Power, that unbiaſſed and unprejudiced Perſons will no more be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Sophiſms, and plauſible pretences, which to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize the Power of the two Houſes at firſt, and after of the Commons Houſe only, the Penmen of the long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made uſe of; yet becauſe many of late were furbiſhing the ruſty Armour of their <hi>Demagogues,</hi> and trimming their Helmets with freſh Plumes, I conceive it neceſſary to take notice of ſome of their chiefeſt Arguments, and examine thoſe which had greateſt Influence upon the People.</p>
               <p>The great and venerable name of Parliament, and its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, was conſtantly uſed as Shield and Buckler, to ward off all the Force of the Loyal Aſſaults; and Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> writ a large Volume, which he ſtiled, The Soveraign Power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments: and when the very Lees and Dregs of the Commons Houſe was put in Ferment, that very Kilderkin would admit no lower Stile, than the ſupreme Authority of the Nation to be pearched on its Bunghole.</p>
               <p>Therefore to diſabuſe the leſs conſiderate,<note place="margin">The various Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the word <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                  </note> and to detect the Frauds of thoſe, which under that great Name applyed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they met with in the Laws, or Hiſtory, to the Houſe of Commons; I think it neceſſary in the firſt place to clear the acceptation of the Word.<note place="margin">Appropriated to the Lords Houſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes the word <hi>Parliament</hi> is uſed for the Houſe of<note n="(a)" place="margin">Egerton, ſect. <hi>4. 22, 23.</hi>
                  </note> Lords only; as when upon Writ of Error, any Judgment in the King's-Bench is examined in the Houſe of Lords, the Judgment is ſaid to be affirmed or reverſed by Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Appellation of <hi>Parliament</hi> is likewiſe uſed for the two Houſes,<note place="margin">To both the Houſes.</note> in regard they are the groſs Body, whereof the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament conſiſts, there only wanting the Sovereign Head to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat it. But they are ſo far from being the High Court of Parliament, that they cannot co-unite to be an entire Court, either of Sovereign or Miniſterial Juſtice, but only in concurring in Votes in their ſeveral Houſes, for preparing of matters, in
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:66310:156"/>order to an act of all the Body; which when they have done, their Votes are ſo far from having any legal Authority in the State, as in Law there is no Stile or Form of their joynt Acts, further than Bills, nor doth the Law ſo much as take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, till they have Royal Aſſent; without which, the Votes of the two Houſes dye in the Womb, like an <hi>Embryo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the proper uſe of the word <hi>Parliament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How properly the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> (as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Law-making is annexed to the name) is only when the King and the two Houſes concurr in one Act, and in that ſence only is the Parliament the Supream Court, the higheſt Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and the moſt Sovereign Power: Not for any Soveraignty in the two Houſes, and from them transferred to the King by their joining and conſenting with him; but becauſe every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect Act of it, is the Act of the perſonal Will and Power of the Sovereign himſelf, ſtanding in his higheſt Eſtate Royal.</p>
               <p>Therefore whoever reads the Authors that writ in defence of the Parliament, muſt conſider this Fallacy they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, that he do not apply the Authoritative Act of the King, with the Conſent of the two Houſes, to the Houſes without the King.</p>

               <p>Now the reaſon why in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's anſwer,<note place="margin">Why in ſome of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's Writings the King was called the Third Eſtate.</note> we meet with the expreſſions of making the King the third Eſtate, was, becauſe at that time, the Biſhops being voted out of the Houſe of Lords, and the two Houſes ſetting themſelves in all the points of Controverſie in oppoſition to the King, the notion of a Triumvirate was more intelligible (as it may be thought)
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:66310:157"/>to the People, and thoſe who were ſo bitter Enemies to the King, and had ſuch a Rebellious force, would have ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Peoples averſion, if the King had aſſerted his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Prerogative otherwiſe. Whether this were the true reaſon, or the overſight of the Penners of his Majeſties Anſwers, I will not undertake to determine; but I am induced to believe the firſt, becauſe, I find the King, and thoſe that writ in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Cauſe, uſing frequently this way of Argument.</p>
               <p>In every State there are three Parts (ſaith<note n="(l)" place="margin">Review of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</note> one, the King or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to write for him) capable of juſt or unjuſt Soveraignty, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prince, Nobles and People. Now through the Piety of our <hi>Lawgiving Princes,</hi> a juſt and regular courſe of Government being obtained, the ſtability of which being found to be more concerned in the Power of making Laws, than in any other Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er belonging to the Soveraign; for preventing of Innovations, that might ſubvert that ſetled regularity, the frame and ſtate of Government was in ſuch a ſort eſtabliſhed, as that the Prince ſhould be limited from uſing the legiſlative Power, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current aſſent of the <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi> By which means the conſtitution of our Parliaments, is ſo equal and geometrical, and all parts ſo equally contribute their Offices, that no part can have an extream predominance over other: Therefore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any evil that might come by the admiſſion of two ſuch Bodies, to a participation of Power, in this particular of making Laws (if they ſhould combine againſt the Soveraign) the Law gives them an equal Power to aſſent or diſſent;<note place="margin">The Ballancing of the Powers in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> ſo that oppoſing the ſingle Power of every one of them, to the Votes of every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, there might be ſo ſecure a balancing of the Power of one againſt the other, that no practice of any two of them, ſhould do any prejudice and diminution to the third, without the third Party it ſelf did give conſent unto it: otherwiſe the King and Peers might oppreſs the Commons, the King and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons oppreſs the Peers, or the Peers and Commons oppoſe the King; and the Peers being eaſily oppreſſed by the Commons (as we ſaw in our late calamitous Times) an <hi>Appian Decemvirate,</hi> or the 30 or 300 Tyrants might get the Power into their own hands.</p>
               <p>In another place he ſaith, Though properly Laws be the Acts of the King in Parliament, yet are they alſo truly the Acts of the whole Parliament; becauſe every of the Eſtates contribute their Power according to the diverſity of their Office and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and ſo as from a ſacred <hi>Tripos,</hi> the civil Oracles of the Law are delivered.</p>
               <p>It is therefore to be conſidered (ſaith a Judicious<note n="(m)" place="margin">King's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy aſſerted, <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 96. where the Reader may find a full Anſwer to the Deductions they make from the King's way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, in anſwer to ſome other paſſages of his Majeſty that the Parliamentarians wreſted) That if his Majeſty, out of a deſire to ſave the effuſion of Blood, uſed ſuch gracious Expreſſions as were moſt likely to prevail with the People, and conſolidate their Minds, they ought not in Equity to prejudice the Rights of the Crown, although he had abdicated therein, ſome parts of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:66310:158"/>his Authority, and granted things deſtructive to his own Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. From his Majeſties ſaying, That the Power, legally pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in both Houſes, is more than ſufficient to prevent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Power of Tyranny, they infer, This cannot be made good without a Power of Reſiſtance; for that Tyranny cannot otherwiſe be reſtrained. Which is eaſily anſwered. For it cannot be underſtood, that the King means by this, a forceable reſiſtance or reſtraint,<note n="(n)" place="margin">Id poſſit quiſquam quod jure poſſit.</note> but a legal one, ſo far as Humane Prudence can by lawful and juſt ways provide. The Power they have by Law, being to inflict puniſhments on evil Inſtruments, whereby others may be afraid to take upon them ſuch Imployments; and they may refuſe to give the King Subſidies, and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Aſſiſtance, if he refuſeth to moderate exceſſes, which are Powers more efficacious than reſiſtance; the ſucceſs of the one being more probable and likely than the other.</p>
               <p>However,<note place="margin">The not aſſerting of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's Prerogative, diſadvantagious.</note> in my poor opinion, it had been more honourable, and probably more efficacious, to have ſpent leſs time in this kind of defending the Kings Intereſt by the Pen, and have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it in aſſerting the true Prerogative of the King, and his undoubted Rights, to have let the People, as well as the Houſes know, what he would reform, and out of Princely Clemency grant, for his Peoples eaſe, and at their earneſt Petition; but neither to have depreciated, or deſcended ſo much below the Majeſty and Dignity of his place, to enter into Reply and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, Altercation, and Apologies with his Subjects. But that King, compoſed all of Mercy, Juſtice, and Tenderneſs to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, judging others by his own Royal Standard of Integrity, let the Houſes ſeize his Ships, Magazines, and left them the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>London</hi>'s Purſe, while he retired to the North, and plied the Houſes with Declarations and Meſſages, to have reduced them to their Duties: and though his condeſcenſions were great, and the way of Argument ſuch as before I have inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in; yet I cannot find (except in that particular of making himſelf one of the three Eſtates) that he yielded any part of his Royal Prerogative, till he was made Priſoner; that in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint he condeſcended to a temporary diveſting himſelf of the Militia, and other things, which all ſorts of Subjects (except the very chief of thoſe in Rebellion againſt him) found infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more tending to the enſlaving, and utter ruine of the People, than ever they could have been, if the King had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged all by his abſolute Will, and the direction of thoſe they accounted his worſt Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>I having in ſeveral places cleared the Kings Soveraignty, ſhall only on this Head endeavour to anſwer the principal of thoſe popular Reaſons the Writers for the Parliament uſed, not grounded upon any Law or Conſtitution of the Government, but only upon the falſe ſuppoſition, That the Wiſdom of the two Houſes was to be valued above the Wiſdom of the King and Council, in propoſing matters for the Royal Aſſent, which were conducible to the Liberty of the Subject, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:66310:158"/>was their whole deſign, and that they would eſtabliſh the Kings Throne in more Glory and Splendor than had ever been in any Ages.</p>
               <p>The firſt and principal Topick they uſed, was,<note place="margin">The Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> not mixed.</note> That the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>England</hi> was in its Conſtitution allayed, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the two Houſes, in making Laws, had ſuch a Copartner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and radical mixture, that they had ſomething more than a Conſultive and Aſſenting part; and that the King was oblig'd in the duty of his Office, and by his Coronation Oath, to grant what they deſired.</p>

But this concludes no more, than that his Power is of ſuch a ſize and bigneſs as the Law hath ordained; and if the Law give the King abſolute, full, and entire Power, and limits him only in the exerciſe of it, this is a reſtraint, and limitation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch Laws as the Soveraign hath eſtabliſhed in that particular alone, and is the happineſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject, that Kings act not Arbitrarily: but this gives no Power to the two Houſes, to be any checks upon the King, who by the ſame Laws hath the Power of putting in execution, and ſuſpending the execution of the Laws in many Caſes; or that Ariſtocracy, or Democracy have any ſuch mixture with the Monarchy, as they can impoſe their Laws upon him. For to ſuppoſe a mixed Monarchy, conſiſting of Three Eſtates, independent for their Authority upon one another, and to have ſeveral ſhares in the Rights of Sovereignty, and to ſay, The Government of three Eſtates, is the Government of one Monarch, is perfect non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: for when<note n="(q)" place="margin">Beſold.

               <p>Whoever will conſider aright of the concurrence of the two Houſes, in preparing Bills, will find,<note place="margin">How the two Houſes concur in making Laws.</note> That though the Houſes be as the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non;</hi> yet the efficient, procatarctick Cauſe, and the Authoritative Power in paſſing theſe into Laws, is the King only; and what the two Houſes do without his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is but as the Counſellor at Law's framing a Deed, and the Clerks Ingroſſing the Indenture of Conveyance; but till the Seal be ſet to it, and delivery made, as the Act and Deed of Donor or Conveyor, it is of no force and virtue; neither do we call it the Act and Deed of the Counſellor or Clerk, but of the Perſon that ſeals it.</p>
               <p>Another Objection thoſe Champions for the two Houſes

And that ſuch is the State of the Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> the Objector thinks clear, becauſe the Houſe of Peers are an Ariſtocracy, and the Commons a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy; and this mixture of Intereſts and Powers being in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Legiſlative Power, he concludes the mixture is in the Root and Supremacy of Power, and not in the exerciſe alone.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which it muſt be conſidered,<note place="margin">Anſwer, That is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Exerciſe of the Power.</note> That though the concurrence of both the Eſtates with the Monarch in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and promulgation of Laws, be ſuch as our Laws deſcribe; yet it is no otherwiſe than in the precedent Chapters, by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable proofs, I have made it out, That what participation ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the two Houſes have with the King in the Legiſlature, it is only derivative from the Crown by the King's Summons, and the reſtriction of thoſe Summons to do and conſent.</p>

                  </note> which every where are owned to be abſolute in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Power.

               <p>So that allowing the Power of the two Houſes as large as can be proved by the Laws (for the ſtretch that the Parliamentarians would make, is by the Tenters they only have ſet up,) the whole latitude of the Nomothetical Power is not jointly in the two Houſes; for none but Strangers to our Laws can deny, That the King hath ſole Power to diſpenſe with the Statutes, and abate their Rigour, where a miſchief would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:66310:159"/>inſue, he alone hath Power by Edicts and Proclamations, to order all Affairs for which there is no order taken by certain and perpetual Laws.</p>

Of Architectonical and Preceptive Power.</note> Architectonical, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive. The Architectonical is that which layeth Materials of Law, and conſiſteth in two things; Firſt, in determining what is juſt, convenient, or neceſſary: Secondly, in declaring, and promulgating that to be actually made a Law, and Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which upon conſultation is thought to be juſt, conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or neceſſary. The firſt ſhews no Jurisdiction in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have it, but only an Office and Imployment to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and conſult. But whoever hath the Second Power, hath a Jurisdiction to define Authoritatively what ſhall be Law; and this Preceptive Power is that which makes the Law ſacred and inviolable, and which giveth it force to oblige the Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Now it is evident by undeniable Teſtimony and Authority, that the exerciſe of the Architectonical Power is only commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the two Houſes, who have <hi>votum conſultivum &amp; deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum,</hi> but it is derived from the King, who hath only the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive Power.

For ſubordinate Agents, that are but Inſtruments of another, and work by a derived Power, when they concur with the Principal and ſupream Agent, have their cauſality in producing the Effect; yet this doth not prove the Authority to be radically in them.

                  </note> Mr. <hi>Sherringham,</hi>) wherein a Man hath a perpetual Right in Fee, his Right is diſtinguiſhed from the King's Right, of whom he holds; the King having the demean of the Land, and the other the demean of the Fee.</p>
               <p>So it is in an Eſtate of Power and Authority; If the King grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an Eſtate of Power, Authority and Jurisdiction in Fee-ſimple, or in Fee-tail, for term, longer or ſhorter, the King hath the demean of Power, and the other the demean of Uſe; the King hath <hi>Dominium directum,</hi> the other <hi>Dominium utile;</hi> which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the two Houſes: but it muſt be likewiſe conſidered, that this diſtinct Authority they have, is wholly derivative, and ſo much the more depending on the Sovereign, as he can at his Pleaſure totally deprive them of the Exerciſe of it by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, or totally annihilate it by Diſſolution.</p>
               <p>Another Objection they made,<note place="margin">Objection, The Three Eſtates to reſtrain the Exceſs of each other.</note> was from the Anſwer the King authorized a Gentleman to make to the Obſerver, That the three Eſtates are conſtituted to the End that the Power of the one ſhould moderate and reſtrain the exceſs of the Power in the other. From which he infers, That this is an Allay and mixture in the Root and eſſence of the Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>To this it may be anſwered,<note place="margin">Anſwer to it.</note> That there is no ſuch Power in the two Houſes; they are called to conſult, and to conſent. All they can do is, that they have the opportunity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:66310:160"/>grievances redreſſed, becauſe they may otherwiſe deny the King the aſſiſtance he deſires. But they have no Authority of themſelves, to redreſs them, or to reſtrain and moderate his Exceſſes by Force, nor can they moderate the Exceſſes of one another by any Act of their own ſingly, further than the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Eſtate ſhall be willing to be moderated.</p>
               <p>It is a moſt abſurd thing to imagine, that when the Law hath placed the Sovereign Power in the King, it ſhould again for a ſpace of time, during the Seſſion of Parliament, unſovereign Him, and place in the two Houſes the ſame Sovereign Truſt, and with a ſecond abſurdity, leave in the King's Hands the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning and diſſolving, the Power by which himſelf ſhould be conſtrained; and to make up all, ſhould by Authority of that Power conſtrain all the Heads of the People, and even the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Body of that Power, by Solemn Oath, to declare that the King is not only ſupreme Governour, but that he is <hi>only</hi> ſupreme Governour.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Arguments they ſued upon this Head of a deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Monarch, that was not only to admit ſome of his Subjects into the Participation of his Burthen, but of his Soveraignty (whereby they pleaded for both the Houſes being joynt-Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns for the time) they uſed other Arguments ſingly for the Houſe of Commons, which they endeavoured to aggrandize, and raiſe to a ſtrange over-towring heighth, above both King and Lords; and they grounded all their Arguments upon the immenſe Power of their being the Peoples Repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>The Obſerver ſaith,<note place="margin">Objection concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Power of Repreſentatives.</note> That the vertue of Repreſentation, is the great Privilege of Privileges, that unalterable Baſis of all Honour and Power, whereby the Houſe of Commons claims the entire Right of all the Gentry and People; and that there can be nothing under Heaven next to renouncing of God, which can be more perfidious, and more pernicious to the People, than the withdrawing from them; and doth acknowledge that the Arbitrary Rule was once moſt ſafe for the World: But now, ſince moſt Countries have found out an Art, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Order for publick Aſſemblies (he means by Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives) whereby the People may aſſume its own Power, and do it ſelf Right, without the diſturbance of it ſelf, or injury to Princes, he is very unjuſt that will oppoſe this Art and Order.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which it ought to be conſidered, That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Body deſerves the higheſt Honour and Obſervance that can be given to the Body Repreſented;<note place="margin">Anſwer, What Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the Subjects.</note> but this Honour will depend upon two things: Firſt the quality and condition of the Body repreſented, and Secondly, on the quality of the Repreſentative it ſelf. If therefore the Body at large were an abſolute Sovereign (as in Republicks,) the true Repreſentative of that Body were to be obſerved with all Sovereign Honour, and due Subjection: But when the Body at large it ſelf is but a Subject (as it is in Monarchy) the Honour and Authority of the Repreſentative, cannot exceed the Honour and Authority
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:66310:160"/>of a Subject; for none can make the Image more than the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, or, without Adulterating Arts, appear ſo. Therefore however abhorrent a Crime he makes it, in ſuch as concurr not in their Judgment with their Repreſentatives that exceed their Authority and Commiſſion: yet all ſober and juſt Perſons ought to conſider that the Subjects by giving Authority to ſome of their own Order, to repreſent them, and adviſe, and conſent for them, gave them no ſuch Power above that of Subjects; yea ſo much above the condition of their Sovereigns, that neither breach of Faith, nor the Oaths of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy (which they never took to them) or any other Duty to their King, was comparable to the withdrawing from the Vote, or Act of their Repreſentators: as if the Rights of the Crown and Kingdom, and the Laws made by the King, with the aſſent of the three Eſtates in Parliament, did not ſo much concern the Commons of the Land; but that againſt all theſe they ſtood ſolely bound to the Repreſentatives, as the only Sovereign of their Obedience. I ſhall now offer ſome Reaſons againſt this dangerous Opinion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is to be conſidered,<note place="margin">Reaſons againſt the Power of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives.</note> That in our Kingdom the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentors are not equally choſen (as in the united Provinces, and other Commonwealths) but it lies in the Power of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign here to make a Town equal in number of Burgeſſes to a County: which doth vehemently demonſtrate, That the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and end of ſuch Repreſentatives was rather to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Information of the State and Condition of that particular place, and adviſe and aſſiſt the Sovereign, and to conſent with him, and not to determine Sovereignly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The cockering the People in that Opinion, that the Soveraignty lies in <hi>Materia prima</hi> in them, and by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, that they may exert it, is the certain way to ruin not only Monarchy, but all government: as was evident in the caſe of the Rebellious Houſe of Commons, in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's time, who prided themſelves ſo much with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Repreſentatives; and by pretext of that and the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their Army, having unyoked themſelves from all Subjection to their Lawful King, and diſengaged themſelves from their dangerous and uſeleſs Collegues, the Lords (as they then voted them) after ſome while they loſt their Honour and Reverence with their own Army, who then would be the People, and pulled them out of their Houſe; juſtly charging them with a deſign to perpetuate themſelves. And ſo the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Supremacy was exerciſed by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and his Council of Officers a while, and after by himſelf, and his mock-Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, by Councils of State and Safety, and ſuch new Names and Powers, as our Laws never heard of; and all this under pretence that they Acted by the Peoples Authority and ſuffrage; and all the ſad Devaſtations of that Age reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the confiding ſo much in the pretended Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the People. Which<note n="(a)" place="margin">

Thus ignorant Politicians that build upon ſuch Quick-ſands, ſoon live to ſee their <hi>Inſanae Structurae</hi> ruinouſly fall about their Ears.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas the Advocates for the Repreſentatives, would gladly have poſſeſſed the People that they could rely upon none ſo ſecurely and ſafely, as upon thoſe they had themſelves choſen; they being leſs ſubject to private ends and affections, than any particular man, ſuch a Body being not likely to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel or conſent to any thing, but what is publickly advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>It is to be conſidered, that it is a falſe <hi>Poſtulatum:</hi> Such a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being but an Aggregate of particulars, may have as many private ends as any other number of Subjects; it being well known, that Communities themſelves are ſubject to dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Inclinations from private Incitements; and I the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives ſubject to miſleading Factions, and Ambitions of private Men; and by coalition of Parties (when they fall into deſigns) they are moſt dangerous and fatally violent: and tho' it may, at firſt View, ſeem to be repugnant, that an Univerſality ſhould have private ends; yet ſeeing it is not the number of Agents, but the capacity in which they act, and the quality of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and the coherence or incoherence of what they purſue (with the publick end and weal) which makes the Actions of men public or private: It muſt needs follow, That if without Authority, or out of the way of Public Ordinances, men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue any thing, though the whole Community concur in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; yet it is all of the nature of a private Action, and done to a corrupt and private end.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the Author of ſome Obſervations upon ſome of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>1ſt.</hi> Meſſages, was reputed the great Champion of the two Houſes, I ſhall content my ſelf with culling out ſome of the daringeſt aſſertions,<note place="margin">Why Reaſon and Law were not hearkned to by the Advocates of the Long Parliament.</note> he and ſome other of their <hi>Triarii</hi> uſed, and apply ſuch of thoſe Anſwers and Reaſonings, as the Learned and Loyal offered then againſt them, though they could not be heard, while the Torrent bore all down the ſtream. The hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous noiſe of Tumults, and after of Drums, Trumpets, Cannons and Fire-Arms huſhed and ſilenced all the ſtill voice of Law and Reaſon: But now it is to be hoped, when Mens Eyes are unſealed, the Mask and Vizard dropped or pulled off, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Conſequences of ſuch pernicious Principles throughly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and the loud Thunder of the Two Houſes Ordinance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, mens Spirits will be better fitted to hear them refuted.</p>
               <p>Beſides what I have endeavoured to anſwer before, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authority of the Repreſentative, which they would make an Aſſembly; in which the People, in underived Majeſty, are by theſe Proxies convened to affirm an Imaginary Power,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:66310:161"/>ſuppoſed to be theirs originally, and in ſuch a convention to be put in execution: I ſay beſides this, which in ſeveral places I have refuted, That filled all their Declarations, Meſſages and Treatiſes, when they were contriving the ſetting up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Houſe Topmoſt, to prove, That they were a Body that was not eaſily corrupted, byaſſed, tempted, or prevailed upon, to Act any thing but what was the beſt for the Peoples advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.

Good Woodmen ſay, That ſome have uſed Deer-ſtealing as an Introduction to a Keepers place. So we have ſeen a Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt's mouth ſtopped (I might inſtance in other Profeſſions) with a good Benefice; whereas, before he was ſatisfied, he could gape as wide as his Neighbours. Others by more only ways ſlip into Preferment; for Covetouſneſs and Ambition will ſail with any Wind. The Covetouſneſs of the Members of the long Parliament by woful experience was found inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; witneſs their Voting for one anothers Offices, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſatisfaction for their loſſes out of Delinquents Eſtates, ſharing the Kings Lands and Revenue, the Biſhops, Deans and Chapters Lands, and the Eſtates of the Royal Party: hence together with the itch of Arbitrary rule, they drew the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Cauſes out of the ordinary Courts of Juſtice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Houſes and Committees of them, and in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had their Sub-committees to Tyrannize over the People and fleece them.</p>
               <p>Their cruelty appeared in their erecting High Courts of Juſtice, Major Generals, and other Arbitrary Courts,<note place="margin">The Cruelty of the Long Parliament.</note> where many a Loyal and brave man, for ſerving his King, againſt ſuch

               <p>The partiality of Members in ſuch Conventions are very frequent,<note place="margin">The Partiality.</note> in ſhielding their friends from being queſtioned, though their Corruptions were notorious to all the World.

Gallant and vertuous actions do not more often ingratiate men with ſuch a mixed body, than a rolling Tongue, a precipitate Head, vain-glorious profuſion, oyly inſinuations, feigned devotions, ſufferings (though deſerved) from Superiours, and above all, oppoſition to the preſent State.</p>
               <p>So the memorable long Parliament of 1641. by the ſpecious pretences of redreſſing Grievances,<note place="margin">The ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Long Parliament.</note> taking care of the Public,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:66310:162"/>and particularly of the Liberty of the Subject and their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, together with vehement Expreſſions of their Reſolutions of Eſtabliſhing the Kings Throne, upon more firm foundations of the peoples Hearts and Affections; by inſenſible Screws wound themſelves into the credit of Patriots, and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by able to carry a numerous party with them in all their Votes, by little and little made ſuch encroachments upon the Soveraignty, that having undermined it, paſt ſupport, they took the advantage of its fall and ruine (out of the ſame ſpecious pretence, that the Commonwealth might ſuffer no detriment) to propoſe their long deſigned Model of Government, not as by them forethought on, but as a neceſſary expedient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the end (as they pretended) they had all this while been aiming at, <hi>viz.</hi> the Peoples proſperity, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> they endeavoured to make the World believe they were moſt Zealous for: when God knows, the upſhot of all was the total diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beſt conſtituted Government, and the Eſtabliſhing themſelves a fattened Commonwealth out of the rich ſpoils of Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Yet theſe very men were they who ſome years before poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed as many as they could delude, with an opinion,<note place="margin">Their Hypocritical Promiſes.</note> that none knew better, nor affected more the ſweetneſs of ſo well ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Monarchy, than they; and that the Kings juſt Authority was Sacred to them that they would make him more rich and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than any of his Predeceſſors. The Obſerver told the World, That it had been often in the Power of former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, to load the Government with greater Fetters and Clogs, but they would not; and that change of Government could not be in their deſires, becauſe the advantage of the Lords and Commons in the State was ſo great, that no change of Government could better them, except each one could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an hereditary Crown. But theſe were but vain flouriſhes and empty aiery offers: ſucceſs altered their Principles, and they were ill troubled to find out excuſes and evaſions after the Murther of the Bleſſed King, and change of Government, for theſe their ſo hypocritical Declarations. From all which I ſhall only deſire that Poſterity may be cautious how they credit the truth of thoſe, who in ſuch Conventions are the moſt active for any Innovation, if they ſee that they zealouſlieſt pretend ſome greater happineſs to the People, by leſſening the Authority of the Crown. It is reported of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Aeneas Sylvius de diaetis Fred. Imp.</note> that in the Speech to the Senators, he deſired them before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Houſe of their Aſſembly, they would leave two things behind them, and then they would give right Judgment; and being asked what thoſe were, he told them,<note place="margin">Simulatio &amp; diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio.</note> Counterfeiting and Diſſembling.</p>
               <p>Another of their Arguments,<note place="margin">How many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors may miſlead.</note> for the preference of the Houſes Counſel before all other Councils, was, that many Eyes of ſo many choice Gentlemen from all parts, ſee more than fewer; which Sophiſm eaſily midwived in the concluſion,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:66310:163"/>that then the two Houſes judgment of Affairs was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the King and his Privy Councils, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons before the Peers; and by a parity of Reaſon (though they deſired not it ſhould be urged ſo far home) that the body of the People was to be preferred before the Commons Houſe, which might be urged upon as common a Proverb, <hi>That By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders ſee more than Gameſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But who are ſo blind as thoſe that will not ſee? Thoſe very Seers if they would have made uſe of their Eyes, to have peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Hiſtories of former Ages, on what ſpecious pretenſions Rebellions had begun, and how the Laws had ſettled the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in an unparallel'd ſecurity of the Peoples Rights, as well as the Prerogative of the Crown, or by ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion foreſeen the certain and inevitable miſeries that would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the weakning of the Crown, and the neceſſitating the King for his defence to take up Arms: theſe quick-ſighted Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might have prevented all thoſe Calamities that enſued.<note place="margin">The Elected like the Electors.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Whoever conſiders how eaſie it is to poſſeſs a People with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt the Government (of which elſewhere I muſt enlarge) will ſoon find that it is no difficult matter to have ſuch Elections of Members as were like to be of the ſame perſwaſion with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors; So that in ſuch caſes, it is not to be wondred at, that a majority of Votes might be oppoſite to more judicious and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing Members judgments; neither is the Maxim univerſally true, for it muſt be <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> if all things be alike. For it is not ſufficient for an Adviſer to ſee, unleſs he can let another ſee by the light of Reaſon. A man ought not implicitely to ground his Actions upon the Authority of other mens Eyes, whether many or few, but of his own. One Phyſician may ſee more into the ſtate of a mans body than many Empiricks. One ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Commander may know more in Military Affairs than ten freſh-water Souldiers. One old States-man in his own Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is worth many new Practitioners. One man upon a Hill may ſee more than an Hundred in a Valley. And who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but among an Hundred, one of them may have a ſtronger Eye, and ſee clearer and further than all the Ninety Nine? So one <hi>Paphnutius</hi> in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſaw more than many greater Clerks. And it is no new thing to find one or two men in the Parliament change the Votes of the Houſe. Therefore nothing is got by this way of arguing, though it be one of the plauſibleſt, and moſt improveable of any of the Topicks they chooſe. And if we could be ſure that all the Members of ſuch Aſſemblies were free from all the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſuch are liable to, much might be yielded to it.</p>
               <p>All theſe Arguments were uſed for that ſole end, that they might poſſeſs their Party with the reaſonableneſs of their deſires to the King, that he would implicitly yield up his reaſon to the guidance of their Councils.</p>
               <p>They were not ſo frontleſs at firſt,<note place="margin">Concerning the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Voice.</note> as poſitively to deny the Kings negative Vote in Parliament, that had never been

And to ſumm up all, he tells us, if the Parliament (meaning the two Houſes) be not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually the whole Kingdom it ſelf; if it be not the ſupreme Judicature, as well in matters of State as matters of Law; if it be not the great Council of the Kingdom as well as of the King to whom it belongeth, by the conſent of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to provide in all extraordinary caſes, <hi>ne quid detrimenti capiat Reſpublica:</hi> let the brand of Treaſon, ſaith he, ſtick upon it. Indeed becauſe by all theſe moſt falſe, and impious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, and thoſe horrid Acts built upon them, they brought ſo great a ruine to the Kingdom, they are and ever will be (u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>leſs a <hi>Platonick</hi> year return again) branded with Rebellion in the higheſt degree.</p>
               <p>To anſwer this Accumulation of Treaſonable Poſitions (for ſuch I hope I may call, in ſome ſence,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> what is againſt the Kings Crown and Dignity) is no ways difficult from the diſcourſe of right conſtituted Parliaments: For thoſe of them that carry any ſhew of Reaſon, are ſuch only as may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Acts of Parliament compleated by the Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but being ſpoken of either or both Houſes in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the King, they are moſt falſe, as I ſhall ſhew in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>For Firſt, If the two Houſes are not bound to keep any Law, no man can accuſe them of breach of any: What ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation can Juſtice lay on them who by a ſtrange vertue of Repreſentation are not capable of doing wrong? But it is well known that Statutes ſtand in full force to the two Houſes, as being not void till repealed by a joynt conſent of the King and the two Houſes. It would be much for the credit of the Obſervers deſperate Cauſe, if he were able to ſhew one ſuch Precedent of an Ordinance made by Parliament without the Kings aſſent, that was binding to the Kingdom in nature of a Law. Our Kings can repeal no Laws by their own Prerogative, though they may ſuſpend the Execution. It ſeems the Houſes would have Power to do both; and our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in another place, thinks it ſtrange that the King ſhould
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:66310:164"/>aſſume or challenge ſuch a ſhare in the Legiſlative Power to himſelf, as without his concurrence the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſhould have no right to make Temporary Orders, for putting the Kingdom into a Poſture of Defence. Theſe were ſtrange Phraſes never heard before by Engliſh Ears. Our Laws give this Honour to the King, That he can joyn or be ſharer with no man. The King like <hi>Solomon</hi>'s true Mother, challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole Child, not a diviſible ſhare, but the very life of the Legiſlative Power. The Commons preſent and pray, the Lords adviſe and conſent, the King Enacts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Houſes have no Power to declare Law.</note> As to their claiming an abſolute Power in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Law, it is as bold and falſe an Aſſertion as the other, when ſpoken of the two Houſes. They may vote in order to a new Bill, the explaining or repeal of any Law formerly made, or prepare a Bill for any New Law, and that is all they can do; but authoritatively to declare any Law, is moſt contrary to the Conſtitution of the Houſes, and never was adjudged one of their Privileges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the Juſtice and Honour of a Parliament, when the State is in quiet, and the Conventions only for making wholſome Laws for the Publick weal, there are no Factions in Court or Country, no private Intriegues to be managed, the People neither uneaſie nor diſcontented; then it is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, That none but the wiſeſt, and wealthieſt of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try will be choſen Members of that Auguſt Aſſembly, and their Juſtice and Honour will be conſpicuous in all their Actions. But have we not known Houſes of Commons compoſed of other kinds of Perſons, who have voted their own Juſtice and Honour to be, to impriſon their fellow Members, and fellow Subjects in an Arbitrary way? How<note n="(d)" place="margin">Addreſs, <hi>part</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 121.</note> could a generous Soul, conſcious to himſelf he had tranſgreſſed no Law, kneel at the Bar of ſuch a Houſe with the ſame ſubmiſſion, as if he believed the Speaker infallible, and every Member an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel!</p>
               <p>But the Obſerver,<note place="margin">Objection, That if the King have a Negative Voice, there will be no need of Parliaments.</note> and his Pewfellows urge, That if the Houſes can do no Act for publick good without the King's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and if the King may reject their Counſels and Advice; it were needleſs to put the Country to the charge of chooſing Members of Parliament. And if the King may prefer other opinions before Parliamentary Motives, then Parliaments are vain and uſeleſs helps, Princes are unlimited, and the People miſerable.</p>
               <p>Theſe Objections are of ſuch an odious nature,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> That no good Subject can take delight in them, whoſe duty is to pray for the like conſent among the ſeveral Orders of the Kingdom, as is ſuppoſed to be among the ſeveral Orbs of Heaven: The King undoubtedly the <hi>Primum movens;</hi> the Great and Privy Council the lower Spheres.</p>
               <p>The uſual (but not the only) form of the Kings Anſwers to ſuch Bills as they were not willing to paſs, <hi>Le Roy s'aviſera,</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:66310:164"/>proves,<note n="(e)" place="margin">Anſwer to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, <hi>p.</hi> 56.</note> That after the advice of this his Great Council, he is yet at liberty to adviſe further with perſons or occaſions, as his own Wiſdom ſhall think meet. But theſe Authors will by no means take notice, That the uſe of Council is to perſwade, not to compel; as if a Man in buſineſs of great concernment might not very prudently conſult with many Friends, and yet at laſt follow the advice perhaps of one, if it appear more proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the end he aims at.</p>
               <p>If it were becauſe they are a more numerous body, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Counſel is upon that account to be yielded to; then the liberty of diſſenting may be denied to the Houſe of Peers, in compariſon of the Houſe of Commons; and to that Houſe too in compariſon of the People: and ſo both King, Lords and Commons are voted out of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Beſides Natural Wiſdom and Fidelity, there is a thing called Experience, of high concernment in the managery of Publick Affairs. He that will ſteer one Kingdom aright, muſt know the right Conſtitution of all others, their Strength, their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, their Counſels and Reſolutions, that upon each diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Face of the Skie, he may alter his Rudder. The beſt Governments have more Councils than one: One for the Publick Intereſt of the Kingdom, another for the Affairs of State, a Council for War, and a Council for Peace.</p>
               <p>Let them be as wiſe and faithful Counſellors as the Obſerver pleaſeth, only let them be but Counſellors.<note place="margin">Neceſſe eſt us Lancea in libra ponderibus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitis deprimi, ſic ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum perſpicuis cedere.</note> Let their conluſions have as much credit as the premiſſes deſerve; and if they can neceſſitate the Prince by weight of Reaſon, and convincing Evidence of experience, let them do it on Gods name. But it is not to be done upon the Authority of a bare Vote, as I think all unintereſted perſons are ſatisfied in the Votes of the Houſes in 1641. about the Militia, Church-Government, and the voted Nineteen Propoſitions, or the late Votes about the Bill of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, the Repealing of the branch of the Statute of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters, and the Loans upon the Kings Revenue. There are other ends beſides Counſel, for which Parliaments are called, as conſenting to new Laws, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Public with Moneys, and maintaining the Intereſt of the Government and liberty of the Subject: from the removing one ſocial end, to inferr that an Action is ſuperfluous, deſerves no anſwer but ſilence and contempt.</p>
               <p>This ſhould teach the Electors Wiſdom not to chuſe ſuch as have Factious Bents, or are not truly qualified in their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to their Prince; or Malecontents, who render ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions uſeleſs to the Publick Ends of Government, and the Peace, Tranquillity, and Proſperity of both Prince and People.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the Long Parliament Writers would have no Stone unturned, nor any ſpecious Argument uninforced,<note place="margin">Concerning the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation-Oaths of the King of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>It is a wonder to me, how men that pretended to any read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or learning in Antiquities, or in the Conſtitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, could defend their Cauſe with ſuch pitiful Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, eſpecially againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, who neither had taken ſuch an Oath, nor many of his Predeceſſors before him.</p>
                  <p>The Latin Tranſlation of two French words gave all the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diſpute; for that which is called <hi>Communate, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Plebs</hi> and <hi>Vulgus,</hi> and <hi>aura eſlu</hi> is tranſlated <hi>elegerit;</hi> whereas, were it to have been underſtood in the Future Tenſe, it ſhould have been <hi>eſlira:</hi> and agreeable to that in all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Records of the Exchequer, the word <hi>elegerit</hi> is Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the Preterperfect Tenſe. Thus much may ſuffice as to the word <hi>elegerit.</hi> Dr. <hi>Brady</hi>'s <hi>Gloſſary</hi> will ſatisfie the Curious about the import of the word it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the word <hi>Vulgus,</hi> one ſolid<note n="(u)" place="margin">Freeholders Grand Inqueſt, <hi>b.</hi> 46. What meant by <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</hi> according to the Opinion of ſome.</note> Author ſaith, That we may be confident, that neither the Biſhops, Privy Council, Parliament, or any other whoſoever they were, that framed or penned this Oath, ever intended in this word the Commons in Parliament, much leſs the Lords: they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much diſparage the Members of Parliament, as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:66310:169"/>them with a Title both baſe and falſe. It had been enough, if not too much, to have called them <hi>Populus,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but <hi>Vulgus,</hi> the Vulgar, the rude multitude (which hath the Epithete of <hi>ignobile vulgus</hi>) is a word as diſhonourable to the Compoſers of the Oath to give, or for the King to uſe, as for the Members of the Parliament to receive; therefore he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that by <hi>Vulgus</hi> muſt be meant the Common People, not the Lords and Commons.</p>
                  <p>But then, ſaith the ſame Author, the doubt will be, what the Common People, or <hi>Vulgus,</hi> out of Parliament have to do to chuſe Laws. In anſwer to which, the preceding word is to be conſidered; <hi>Conſuetudines quas Vulgus elegerit,</hi> the Cuſtoms which the Common People have choſen. If we obſerve the nature of Cuſtom,<note place="margin">Cuſtoms choſen by the Vulgar, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People.</note> it is the <hi>Vulgus,</hi> or Common People only who chuſe Cuſtoms. Common uſage, time out of mind, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates a Cuſtom; and the commoner the uſage is, the ſtronger and the better is the Cuſtom. No where can ſo common an uſage be found, as among the Vulgar, who are ſtill the far greateſt part of every multitude. If a Cuſtom be common through the whole Kingdom with us, it is all one with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of <hi>England,</hi> which is often called Common Cuſtom; ſo that to protect the Cuſtoms which the Vulgar chuſe, is to ſwear to protect the Common Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Agreeable to this, is what the learned Dr. <hi>Brady</hi>
                     <note n="(w)" place="margin">Gloſſary, p. <hi>36.</hi>
                     </note> notes, That upon the whole, it ſignifies no more than that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity had choſen, that is owned, ſubmitted to, and deſired ſtill to uſe their Old Cuſtoms, which by uſe, time out of mind, they had enjoyed for the better management of Affairs, and Conveniency betwixt Man and Man, all the Nation over, or in any particular County, Hundred, Town, City or Burrough, ſuch long practices being the foundation of all Cuſtoms: but theſe are to be juſt, which intrench not upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Laws, and by permiſſion and ſufferance only become Laws.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Oath that our preſent King <hi>James</hi> the Second took at his Coronation,<note place="margin">The Oath of King <hi>James</hi> the Second.</note> was in the ſame Words as that of his Royal Brother; wherein the Word <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> is to be taken in the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt extent, to include <hi>Laws</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>Now upon the whole we muſt conſider Firſt,<note place="margin">Conſiderations upon this Diſcourſe of the Coronation Oaths.</note> That in the Eye of the Law the King never dyes, ſo that he is King before any Solemnity of Coronation. Secondly, The variety of Forms and Precedents, ſeem to prove that one preciſe form is not ſimply neceſſary; ſo the interlining of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth upon Record alſo ſhews. And if it had been of conſequence to have retained the old form, we ſhould have heard of it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then or in ſome ſucceeding Parliaments. Laſtly, it cannot be
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66310:170"/>denied, that if the King be bound by a lawful Oath to paſs all Bills, it is not the form of denying it, but the not doing of it which makes the Perjury. And ſo when the King is tender of a flat denial, and attributing ſo much to the judgment of his great Council, that he only uſeth the words <hi>aviſera;</hi> it would be a ſtrange Doctrine, that all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> who have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this Anſwer, have been forſworn, and neither Parliament nor Convocation taken notice of it in ſo many Ages.</p>
                  <p>But when by dint of Argument the Parliament Champions were driven from theſe Holds, they fled to their laſt Burrow. So one of them confeſſes, that in Acts of Grace the King is not bound to aſſent, nor in Acts wherein he is to depart from the particular right and intereſt of his Crown; and laſtly that if he do not conſent (however bound by Oath) yet they are not binding Laws to the Subject.<note place="margin">How the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Writers would have the King part with his Prerogative in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of neceſſity only.</note> But then comes the handful of Gourds which ſpoils the Pottage: Except in caſes of neceſſity; If the ſafety of the People be concerned; If it may prove dangerous or inconvenient to them, then an extraordinary courſe may be taken.</p>
                  <p>This was the plauſible Plea of 1641. to get the Militia into their hands: for they urged that in caſe of apparent and imminent danger, the Peoples ſafety was not to be neglected; They might not be expoſed as a prey to their Enemies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be put into a poſture of defence. This was grateful to the People, out of that real love they bare to themſelves, they muſt favour that ſide which pretends to take care of their ſafety. Give to any Perſon or Society a Legiſlative Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King in caſe of neceſſity,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Anſwer to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv. <hi>b.</hi> 76.</note> permit them withal to be ſole Judges of neceſſity, when it is, and how long it laſts: and then it is more than probable, the neceſſity will not determine, till they have their utmoſt deſires, which is the ſame in effect as if they had the Legiſlative Power.</p>
                  <p>Further it muſt be conſidered that neceſſity upon that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition muſt be very evident, there needs no ſuch great ſtir who ſhall be Judge of it; when it comes indeed, it will ſhew it ſelf; when extream neceſſity is diſputable, it is a ſign it is not real. Secondly, The Agent muſt be proper, otherwiſe it cuts in ſunder the very Sinews of Government, to make two ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premes in a Society, and to ſubject the People to contrary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                  <p>But to claim ſuch a Power over the King in extraordinary caſes alone,<note place="margin">That the Houſes ſhould be Judges of this Neceſſity.</note> doth not much vary the caſe: for at the ſame time they voted themſelves the proper Judges of ſuch neceſſities, and the erecting of any ſuperintending Power in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thoſe times, and in all parallel caſes, would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unſoveraign the King (by making this Power the Soveraign) but the exerciſe of it would be ſubject to more dangerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances than Regal Power is, and yet leſs capable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation than it. For the Law knowing there is none but God, <hi>qui cuſtodiat ipſos cuſtodes,</hi> concludes from the weakneſs and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:66310:170"/>imperfection of every other form of Government, that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of Law-making was better placed in the hands of a ſole Prince, than in a Popular or Ariſtocratical hand; and that a poſitive known Law without any coercive Superintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent was a ſufficient, and the beſt boundary of Regal Power: For the Law and the Tranſgreſſion of it, being both at once made manifeſt and notorious, it will be ſo ſufficient<note n="(c)" place="margin">Review of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</note> ſecurity of the future obſervance of the Law, that Princes will not offer to violate it. Now if ſuch a Supreme Power, as theſe would have in the two Houſes, in what caſe ſoever, be once enacted, that muſt either be boundleſs or circumſcribed by a Laws; and if that be circumſcribed with a Law, then muſt that Law alſo have a Superiour Power to enforce it: and ſo there muſt be a Superiour Power over Superiour Power <hi>in infinitum,</hi> and yet at laſt leave the moſt Superiour Power in that liberty which the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver calleth boundleſs, Arbitrary and Tyrannical.</p>
                  <p>If this Principle were true,<note place="margin">By the Arguments of the Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Writers, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty is not in the King, but in the People.</note> all is but miſleading formality of Law, the Soveraignty is not in the King but in the People; the King is the only Subject and but a common Voucher, whoſe concurrence is unavoidably implied; his Will, his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and his Power are all ſubject to the Body of the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that in Parliament doth ſwear ſubjection to him: and theſe pretended Rights being hid ever ſince the beginning of the Kingdom, the whole generation of the Subject ever ſince, hath by the injury of our Laws been moſt impiouſly mis-ſworn in their Allegiance. And whereas the truſt is irrevocably commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the King and his Heirs for ever, how can it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it ſhould ſleep during the ſitting of a Parliament, unleſs that jocular ſaying of King <hi>James</hi> were to be underſtood real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That during the Seſſions of a Houſe of Commons there were five hundred Kings? And if any ſuch Power were in the Houſes, it was a ſtrange overſight to leave it to the Kings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, when to call the Body together, and when to diſſolve it (as before I have touched) whereby the King might ſolely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin where, and how long he would be over-ruled, and when King again: whereas by the falſe ſuggeſtion of the Obſerver (that it was fit the Houſes ſhould have a Superintendent Power, in caſe of extraordinary danger, and they only to be Judges of that danger) he cunningly turns the Tables, and makes the Houſes to be Soveraigns as long as they pleaſed; and when they were weary of reigning, the Kingdom ſhould be out of danger, and then it ſhould be the Kings turn to command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>But to draw to a concluſion on this ſubject, which coſt ſo much Blood and Treaſure: There<note n="(d)" place="margin">Anſw. to Obſerv. <hi>p.</hi> 72, 73.</note> neither is nor can be the ſame neceſſity of obſerving an old Law, to which a King is obliged by his Charter and his Oath, and of a new Law to which he hath not given his Royal Aſſent. If <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> extended to this, it were <hi>Charta Maxima,</hi> the greateſt Charter that ever was granted. To be be denied nothing, is a
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:66310:171"/>Privilege indeed as good as <hi>Fortunatus</hi> his Purſe; or as that old Law which one found out for the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> That he might do what he would.<note place="margin">The King's Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Voice Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> The taking away the Kings Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Voice, may indeed ſecure us againſt Tyranny, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can come in upon us, as long as the two Houſes<note n="(e)" place="margin">Idem, p. <hi>136.</hi>
                     </note> Negatives ballance it; but it leaves us open and ſtark naked to all thoſe Popular evils and Epidemical diſeaſes, which flow from Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Government, as Tumults, Seditions, Civil Wars, and the <hi>Ilias</hi> of Evils which attends them; the Negative Voice being the Soveraigneſt remedy againſt ſuch great Miſchiefs.</p>
                  <p>One Wheedle I find more they uſed, ſince the King was ſo tender of violating his Coronation Oath, in giving Aſſent to their new Bills, which were diametrically oppoſite to the old fundamental Laws, made in defence of Epiſcopacy, and the Kings Prerogative in the Militia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they quit their Title of Parliament men,<note place="margin">That the King is not bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, where what is deſired is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to the People than himſelf.</note> and would be Caſuiſts to reſolve his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, telling him that where the People by Publick Authority, will ſeek inconvenience to themſelves, and the King is not ſo much intereſted as themſelves, it was more inconvenience and injuſtice in the King to deny than to grant it.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Houſes would have granted the King a Diſpenſation to have acted againſt the dictates of his Reaſon, Conſcience, and the fundamental Laws. And becauſe he would not own their Commiſſion for it, they perſecuted him to the Scaffold. This was an unheard of Villany to be offered to ſo Pious and Religious a Prince, that as Father of his People, would not give them a Stone inſtead of Bread, or a Scorpion inſtead of a Fiſh. The Heathen was much honeſter, who prayed <hi>Jupiter</hi> to give him good things, though he never opened his Mouth for them; and to withhold bad and prejudicial things, though he petitioned never ſo earneſtly for them. This was a ſtrange Principle, that the King ſhould be bound by Law to deſtroy his People, or not preſerve their Right, unleſs he not only violate his own Conſcience, but their very Liberties. Can a man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine thoſe People, of whom <hi>Juvenal</hi> ſpeaks,
<q>
                        <l>—evertere domos totas optantibus ipſis</l>
                        <l>Dii faciles—</l>
                     </q> if they had underſtood their own Prayers, would have accuſed the Gods for denying them.</p>
                  <p>As they thus ſought to huſh the Kings Conſcience, ſo that endeavoured to find a quaint <hi>ſalvo</hi> for their own more brawny ones: For when it was urged, that to deny the Kings Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Voice, was to diſſolve the excellent conſtitution of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and was directly againſt the ſettlement of it upon the true baſis of the Ballance, and the mutual ſtipulation of the King and his People, as they loved to phraſe it they anſwer by their Prolocutor, that thoſe who contract to their own ruin, or eſteem ſuch Contracts before their own preſervation, are
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:66310:171"/>felonious to themſelves, and rebellious to Nature. Inferring from thence, That if the legal Conſtitution of Government,<note place="margin">The Writers for the Parliament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That where the Houſes think the Conſtitution of the Government is not agreeable to the Liberty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they may alter it.</note> be not agreeable to the Liberties the Houſe conceives needful for them, they are obliged to contend to alter them: which is no more nor leſs, than if a Criminal being condemned to be hanged, ſhould be guilty of another Felony and Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Nature to yield to the Sentence, but that he ought in his own defence to kill as many as he could, that he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſave his life by eſcape.</p>
                  <p>Thus I hope I have made apparent the falſhood of the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ranged in defence of that diſmal Parliament,<note place="margin">How the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament voted all the Power into their own Hands.</note> who made uſe of them as Platforms upon which to plant the Artillery of their Acts and Ordinances. For under the pretext of their obligation to preſerve the Kingdom, they voted to put it in a poſture of defence; and they voted from the King his Navies, Officers, Privy Counſellors, and Revenues, pretending the Navies were ſtill reſerved for the King, in better hands than he would put them, and for the other they would furniſh him with better principled Miniſters. Whereas by the ſame Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Subjects were bound to give up their Eſtates to their ordering, as often as they pretended they could diſpoſe of them more wiſely. For they might alledge, the State (which they reputed themſelves) had an intereſt paramount in them in caſe of publick extremity: ſo that as they pretended the Head without the Body was the State before, ſo now it was fit the Body ſhould be without the Head; whereas the Law hath provided againſt either exorbitances: and if there was neceſſity we muſt fall into one, we ought in reaſon to chuſe the former, becauſe being better acquainted with that, we could better digeſt it; and it would be leſs burthenſom to our Eſtates to ſatisfie one than five hundred, nay ten thouſand, as it appeared when the greedy Commonwealths men with their Committees, Armies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was that flat Vermine in the Bowels, which (how true ſoever it is of the <hi>lumbricus latus</hi>) was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true of this Monſter, That it was every where Head and Mouth.</p>
                  <p>It is to be well weighed,<note place="margin">When Parliaments beneficial, when not.</note> that as Parliaments are in the higheſt degree beneficial, when they keep within the bounds of duty and ſobriety; ſo when they will have their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to have the force of Laws, and not govern themſelves by known Laws, they are the cauſe of many Diſtempers in a Kingdom, and the Subjects condition is moſt unhappy in the Multitude of Phyſicians: for extraordinary Remedies, ſuch as they always pretend to uſe, are, ſaith Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> like hot Waters which may help at a pang, but being too often uſed ſpoil the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>A Compleat Parliament is that<note n="(f)" place="margin">Anſwer to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv. <hi>p.</hi> 150.</note> Panchreſton or Soveraign Salve for all Sores; but ſome would make the name of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament a <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s Head to transform reaſonable men into Stones, and ſubordinate Monarchy to the two Houſes, who

Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the condeſcenſions of our Wiſe and Gracious Princes, there are ſeveral things in <hi>England,</hi> the King cannot by Law do alone, it is a moſt requiſite Wiſdom in Princes, that as they obſerve the Laws in ſecuring the Peoples Liberties and Privileges; ſo by no Arbitrary Aſſumption of either or both Houſes, to let their Prerogatives be invaded: for thoſe are now no more than are rationally and politically neceſſary for orderly and eſtabliſhed Government.</p>
                  <p>The Encroachments of the never to be forgotten long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, (ſeveral of which I have in this and the foregoing Chapter hinted) may be ſufficient documents to Princes, not to yield ſuch a body too much Power: for if the ballance once decline, a little weight will ſink it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore though Princes are not to enlarge their Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, <hi>nova ſiti ad alia aliaque properare;</hi> yet they ought to preſerve thoſe that remain.

                  <p>Above all things a Prince ſhould he careful never to part with the Prerogative of Summoning and Diſſolving Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For we cannot forget that the Houſes of 1641. not content with a Bill for Triennial Parliaments, got an Act for perpetuating themſelves; and that would not ſatisfie, but they prepared a Bill for the certainty of future Parliaments, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King had occaſion for them or not: ſo that if the King omitted the ſending out of Writs and Summons, the Chancellor might, and for failure the Sheriff, and I know not what inferiour Officers; of which the Bleſſed King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains.</p>
                  <p>I cannot diſmiſs this Subject without taking notice of the Fundamental cauſe of Factious Members of Parliament.<note place="margin">The fundamental Cauſe of Factious Members in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> In <hi>England</hi> there is no ſuch powerful Engine to make Faction and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:66310:172"/>Sedition formidable and dangerous to Government, as when the Majority of the Freeholders are wrought upon (by the Arts I have in ſome meaſure hinted before, and ſhall more largely in the Chapter of Faction) to chuſe Members of the Houſe of Commons of their own Temper: for ſuch a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber being imbodied in that Houſe, give and receive mutual ſtrength from one another. For when ſuch are met, they do not take care to unite the minds of the Subjects to their Prince, or one to another, or imploy their time upon the great concerns of the Nation; but are drawn to promote private Animoſities under<note n="(h)" place="margin">King's Speech, 6 <hi>March,</hi> 1678.</note> pretence of the Publick; and are ſo far from proceeding calmly and peaceably to curb the motions of unruly Spirits that endeavour to diſturb them, that they expoſe the King to the Calumny and danger of thoſe worſt of men, who endeavour to render him and his Government odious to the People. I ſhall now touch upon ſome of the Artifices uſed to bring in ſuch Members in the Parliament of 1678. and ſome ſucceeding ones whereby their Conventions were rendred uſeleſs for the King and People, and inglorious to themſelves, though they pretended to as much Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Publick good as thoſe in 1641. did at their firſt ſitting.</p>
                  <p>The King having diſſolved the long Parliament and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned this to ſit the 6th of <hi>March,</hi> 1678.<note place="margin">The Artifices uſed by deſigning People, to get ſuch as they deſired, to be elect ed.</note> the induſtry of the Diſſenters, Male-contents, and we may ſuppoſe Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths men, was extraordinary great, as now hoping they ſhould be able to chuſe ſuch Members as would be more favourable to them.</p>
                  <p>They had been long inſtilling into the Peoples Heads,<note place="margin">The Characters they gave Men of the Court-party.</note> that in the former Houſe there had been a Court and Country Party, the former were for Arbitrary Government, fleecing the People, Perſecution, and ſuch as gave no great credit to the Tragical repreſentation of the Popiſh Plot: The latter were moderate men, and not ſo much for Ceremonies as the purity of Religion, would ſtand for the Peoples Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, by riding night and day about the Villages, and trudging about Corporations, and the weekly Conventicles, they ſpread this Character abroad, and with all the Arts ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, endeavoured to proſelyte<note n="(i)" place="margin">Addreſs, <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 2, 3.</note> all that were not ſharp-ſighted enough to pierce into their deſigns. If any ſeemed not to believe thoſe Characters, or declared himſelf for the Government, Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, eſtabliſhed by Law, and neither for Popery or Arbitrary Government, nor yet for a Commonwealth or Diſſenters, they run them down with noiſe, traduced them behind their backs as Papiſts in Maſquerade and men of Arbitrary Principles.<note place="margin">Papiſts in Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade.</note> And if any were ſo bold as to ſcruple the coherence of the Narratives of the Popiſh Plot, he was vilified as a Defamer of the Kings Evidence, as ſtifler of the Plot; and from hence they concluded to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate into the Populace, that thoſe Loyal Gentlemen who had been Members of the late long Parliament, had joyned with
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:66310:173"/>the Court to hinder the Diſcovery of the Plot; and if any gainſaid them, they uſed ſuch queſtions, What, Are you for Popery? Will you give your Voice for a Papiſt? Are you willing to have your Throat cut? Are you for Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? By which means they won over too many to joyn with them,<note place="margin">Excluding Loyal and Orthodox Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> to exclude many Loyal and Orthodox Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from being choſen Members of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Their deſign was advantaged becauſe ſome were their friends of old, others had come the half way over to gain the reputation of moderate men, others had been diſguſted by the Government. The Conventicle Teachers rallied up their Flocks, and they all joyned to ſlander the Clergy as if they had a kindneſs for Popery in their hearts, though they durſt not diſcover it for the preſent: And generally blaſted all the Loyal Gentry as Popiſhly affected, the Court-Party Penſioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that if any one bore any Publick Office Military or Civil, he was <hi>eo nomine</hi> to be rejected. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they recommended to the People to be choſen, were firſt all thoſe Gentlemen, who called themſelves the Country<note n="(k)" place="margin">Idem, p. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> Party, who had appeared moſt zealous againſt his preſent Majeſty, the Queen Dowager, and Miniſters of State. To theſe they added as many as they could of the reliques of the old Rebellion, or their Children, and made up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber out of the moderate and diſcontented Gentlemen, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes and Tradeſmen. It was ſufficient recommendation if the Government had diſplaced any, for theſe were looked upon as not to be corrupted or bought off: and here and there they took in an honeſt Gentleman, in hopes to win him to their ſide by this kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>After the diſſolution of this Parliament, when his late Majeſty iſſued out his Writs for another to convene, 17 <hi>Oct.</hi> 1679. they added to their former Arts the loud clamours againſt <hi>French</hi> Penſioners,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>French</hi> Penſioners.</note> Popery, Arbitrarineſs, and all thoſe who voted againſt the Bill of Excluſion, as Popiſhly affected, or downright Papiſts; traducing his Majeſty, the Court, the Miniſters of State, and almoſt all the Loyal Gentry and Clergy for endeavouring to have thoſe men choſen. The ſecond advantage they made was the pretended diſcovery of<note n="(l)" place="margin">Addreſs, <hi>part</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> Sir <hi>Stephen Fox</hi> of the Penſioners of the late long Parliament: which diſcovery being haſtily made, and no Record of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred,<note place="margin">Penſioners to the King.</note> they took the confidence to add to it whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pleaſed to have ſo thought; They made the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe they knew who would be Penſioners likewiſe, and led the diffidence to that height, as to exclude as far as they could poſſibly, not only all the Courtiers and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had any places of profit and advantage under his Majeſty, but their Relations too, and wanted not much that they had excluded all thoſe who bore any Honorary Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that nothing recommended a man ſo effectually for a Parliament man, as that he had not been thought fit
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:66310:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be truſted in the leaſt by his then Majeſty, or their Neighbour Gentry, theſe they cried up as true Friends to the Proteſtant Religion, and the Country; and he was an hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Man in their Dialect, who called the Sincerity of their Loyal Intentions in queſtion: However by their Actings, many of them have been diſcovered to be but cold Friends to the Government.</p>
                  <p>But Intending to diſcourſe more fully of the ſeveral Arts us'd by deſigning Men in the Chapter of Factions, I ſhall at preſent quit this Subject, and only deſire Kings to conſider, that they can condeſcend no lower to gratifie Importunities of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or People, in yielding up any of their Privileges.</p>

This, as well as other Reaſons, muſt needs demonſtrate, That if ever any two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament ſhould by Arts of Inſinuation (as that of 1641. did, That unleſs the King would grant they might not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved without their Conſents,<note place="margin">Kings never to yield what the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for.</note> they could not have time to ſettle his Throne, and redreſs Grievances) or by denying ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Supplies, force a King to grant them a Power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing their own Sitting, or meeting at ſtated times without his Writ, or yielding to their Bills implicitly, (as the Black Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of 41. endeavoured) and then to have the Power of nominating the Great Miniſters of State, and the Officers of the Militia, an end would be ſoon put to Monarchy.</p>

                  <p>The third,<note place="margin">When no good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence betwixt the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> when there is no good Correſpondence betwixt the Lords and Commons; which happens, when ſome People out of deſign to render the meeting of the two Houſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, do project ſome matters, whereby the Houſes may claſh about Privileges, as was lately in <hi>Shirley</hi>'s Caſe, about the Mony-Bill from the Houſe of Lords, and many other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars might be inſtanced in; therefore Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſaith, That when it was demanded by the Lords and Commons, what might be a principal Motive for them to have good ſucceſs in Parliaments,<note place="margin">Sitis inſuperabiles, ſi fuertis inſeparabiles.</note> it was anſwered, They ſhould be inſuperable, if inſeparable, <hi>Cum radix &amp; vertex Imperii in Obedientium con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſu rata ſunt.</hi> The very root and top of Government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the conſent of the Obedient, and the Subjects Happineſs is in that Harmony, when it is betwixt the two Houſes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves: but much more happy, when it is likewiſe betwixt the Sovereign, and the two Houſes. It is that which compleats their own, and the Peoples Felicity. But when the two Houſes, or one of them, are for wreſting the Sovereigns Prerogative from him, as in Forty one, then it is the moſt fatal and ill-boding ſign of any other.</p>

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:66310:174"/>an ancient cuſtom in Parliament, in the beginning thereof, to appoint a ſelect Committee to conſider of the Bills in the two preceding laſt Parliaments that paſſed both Houſes, or either of them, and ſuch as had been preferred, read, or committed, and to take out of them ſuch as were moſt profitable for the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>To theſe may be added a moſt material one,<note place="margin">When Redreſs of Grievances are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the King.</note> that makes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Congreſſes of Parliaments, <hi>viz.</hi> When the Members come up, with ſtrong Reſolutions to provide Remedies for ſome Grievances, either real or ſurmiſed, and at the ſame time the Sovereign is in great Straights, for ſupplies for the ſafety, repute, or neceſſary occaſions of the Government; for then (as in moſt of the Parliaments of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt) the Houſes are for redreſs of Grievances, before ſupply, how preſſing and urgent ſoever, and do not credit the King that he will give them time to redreſs them, after he is ſupplied; and they from deſign, rather than this diffidence, will not ſuffer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and grievances to go <hi>pari paſſu,</hi> Hand in Hand, as we may remember in thoſe Parliaments, wherein the popular Men made ſuch Harangues, that they would know whether they were Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or Slaves, or had any thing to give before they entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the giving part: The like we ſaw in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reign, in ſome of his laſt Parliaments, whereby all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations were abortive; and both the Kings had no other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient but Prorogation, or Diſſolution; and diſuſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſome Years followed.</p>

                  <p>How happy had our Forefathers been if King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt had met with ſuch conſiderate Parliaments, who by a ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupply and compliance, might have had (without that vaſt effuſion of Blood and Treaſure) all their Grievances redreſſed, and the flouriſhing State of the Kingdom preſerved, and the Memories of a great many Noblemen and Gentlemen had been tranſmitted without ſtain to their remote Nephews.</p>
                  <p>But to draw towards a Concluſion of this Diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Some not willing to hear of the Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, think this Diſcourſe needleſs.</note> Some that may not be willing to hear of the Miſcarriages of ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, wherein probably they were concerned, may ſay, what need is there now, to bring again upon the Stage the rigorous Proceedings of the two Houſes of Parliament, or more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the leading and deſigning Men in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in the Years 1640, and 1680. ſince we are now happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:66310:175"/>paſt theſe Rocks, Quickſands, and treacherous Shores.</p>
                  <p>All the World indeed muſt acknowledg we have a Royal, wiſe Pilot,<note place="margin">Becauſe we have a moſt wiſe King, and good Parliament.</note> who knows full well to ſteer the Soveraignty of the Commonweal. He hath weathered out high going Seas; ſo that neither their over-whelming liquid Mountains, nor the terrible Shot from the floating Caſtles have daunted him; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, unparallel'd Courage, and an Experience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond moſt Crowned Heads, have raiſed him great Trophies of his Victorious toils: He is ſerved with ſage Councils, both private and National. So that all muſt confeſs we have leſs cauſe to fear any more dangers of Hurricanes and Shipwracks.</p>
                  <p>But though we now enjoy <hi>Halcyon</hi> days,<note place="margin">Yet we are not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure but that in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Ages evil Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament may be.</note> under a Sovereign, enriched with Royal abilities to the heighth of our Wiſhes; though he is bleſſed with a Parliament, as Loyal as can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, betwixt whom there is no other Strife, but who ſhall out-paſs the other in mutual Obligations: Yet are we ſecure, that no ill Exhalations may be gathered in after-Ages?</p>
                  <p>Can we expect always temperate Weather, pleaſing Sunſhine, and fruitful Showres? No, in ſmall revolutions of Years we find Epidemical Diſeaſes return; exceſſes of Drought, Rains, or Froſts, are often marked in our Annals, even after promiſing Configurations of the Coeleſtial Bodies.</p>
                  <p>I write not an Almanack for a Year,<note place="margin">The Deſign of the Author in writing againſt the Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of ſome.</note> or Pamphlet for a time, my Deſign is not <hi>Infandum renovare Dolorem</hi> out of any Pique; but as much as in me lies to ſhow from the by-paſt Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Exorbitances of ſome Men, how Loyal, good, and Juſt Men may meaſure things by the Golden Standard of the Laws; how miſchievous Practices and Principles may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated; how every one may ſee what the upſhot of rebellious Principles will be; how to detect, and how to avoid the ſame kind of Rocks and Sands in after-Ages.</p>
                  <p>I know ſome Perſons recovered from a valitudinary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Some love not to hear of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</note> love not to hear of the Torments they have undergone, nor of the Extravagances of their delirous State: Yet this ſhould not hinder but the Healthful, and thoſe that would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Calenture, ſhould patiently endure to hear a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Cauſes and Symptoms.</p>
                  <p>In this Diſcourſe I have only culled out ſuch Particulars,<note place="margin">The Author's Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for himſelf.</note> as I find Judicious Authors have inſiſted upon, againſt the unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedented Proceedings of ſome late Houſes of Commons; which I think all Loyal Perſons diſapprove; and I believe a great many as well as my ſelf, have heard many of the then ſitting Members diſlike, when things were carried with an impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Torrent, that it was more dangerous to ſpeak againſt their proceedings, or queſtion the unlimited Power aſſumed by that Houſe, than it was to ſpeak Seditious (I had almoſt ſaid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable) Words againſt the King.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I hope none of this preſent Honourable Houſe of Commons (who have ſo ſignalized their Loyalty in the laſt Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) will take offence at what, from ſuch judicious Perſons as
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:66310:175"/>I have met with, I have delivered the Sentiments of. My inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no ways to leſſen the Rights, or neceſſary Privileges of that venerable Aſſembly; which never can be unbeneficial to the King, or People, but when Diſcontent, Faction, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition hath too ſpreadingly infected the Electors.</p>
                  <p>The continuance of that worſt of Parliaments of 1641.<note place="margin">What evil Principles taught during the Long Parliament.</note> in their diſloyal Practices ſo long, by the overgrowing of the Tares, which were only ſuffered to thrive, occaſioned ſo much corrupt ſeed to be ſown, as in twenty years there was no wholeſom grain left. We ſaw too late, how by ſome evil Seedſmen, a fertile, but dangerous Crop was ſhooting up apace. It is not a little Labour, nor ſmall diligence, will howe and weed out the Briars, Thiſtles, and deſtructive Shrubs, and poyſonous Weeds, that ſhoot their ſpreading Roots ſo far: But I hope the great Wiſdom of this Loyal Parliament, will find out ways and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to prevent the danger of their thriving in a Soil, worthy of better Plants, than any will be ſet by Republican Hands.</p>

               <p>It is in vain for Princes to take Counſel concerning matters,<note place="margin">Choice of Perſons.</note> if they take not Counſel likewiſe concerning Perſons; for the greateſt Errors are committed, and the moſt Judgment ſhown in Individuals.</p>
               <p>There was never King bereaved of the Benefit of Counſel, except when there hath been an over greatneſs in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, or an over-ſtrict Combination in divers: which are things ſoon found out, and helped; therefore <hi>Principis maxima eſt virtus noſſe ſuos.</hi>

Therefore Princes ſhould take the Opinion of their Council, both ſeparate, and together; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinion being more free, and Opinion before others more reverend.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a Prince's greateſt Intereſt to be unprejudicate, and to keep an open Ear to all wholeſome Counſel; for as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitolinus</hi>

Yea he was next to <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> on whom the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Emperors reſted. But withal he lets us ſee what old Miniſters of State may expect, and what they muſt not be troubled at, if they find happen to them, That in their old Age they retain the Countenance rather of the Princes Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, than Power, as he expreſſeth it, <hi>aetate provecta ſpeciem magis, in amicitia Principis, quam vim tenuit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The State Mountebanks of 1641. (that they might make the Ulcer ſeem greater,<note place="margin">The Arts of the Long Parliament to remove Miniſters of State.</note> and more dangerous for the advantage of larger Application) firſt aggravated the Grievances the People lay under, by the ill conduct of the prime Miniſters of State, and by the repreſenting a plauſible Idaea of better Government (if they might have the modelling of it) courted by little and little the well meaning, and captivated them with a fair view of its ſpeculative Excellence, whereby their Fancies were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the expectation of a golden Age, and the cunning and intrieguing Factors (pretending to have no other deſign but to take care of the publick) gained to themſelves the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble name of Patriots.</p>
               <p>Having thus tickled their Proſelytes, and gained their applauſe, their next work was to pickeer ſome great Officers, and Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening them with the name of Male-Adminiſtrators, or corrupt Officers, ſlily endeavoured to obtain an Opinion of their own incorruptneſs; whereas their great deſign was only to diſplace
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:66310:182"/>ſuch, to make Niches for their own Statues; and when they found it was difficult to get ſuch outed of their Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the People were acquainted that ſuch and ſuch were the only Rubs, and cloſe Enemies to the State: and when they could have no particular Evidence againſt them, then they made the People believe, that ſuch managed their Deſigns ſo much more cloſely and ſecretly, whereby they could get no publick Proof againſt them; and ſo they left them to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemnation of the People, which ſerved for Jury and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: and being thus preſented, as ingrateful Monſters to their County, they were baited in every Coffee-houſe, and Ale-bench, till at laſt the loud Cry runs through the Woods and Lawns; and every one was armed to deſtroy thoſe reputed Wolves and Foxes that were believed would deſtroy their Flocks; and all the Umbrages of Mis-Government, the real or imaginary Infelicities, were heaped upon the Animals deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Sacrifice, and they were ſingled for victims to concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate better times. And thus ſuch Deſigners being proſperous in their Undertakings againſt the great Miniſter of State, the moſt renowned Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> (whoſe Fall ſucceeding Ages will never forget) they ſingled out others by way of Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both Biſhops and Judges, as was moſt conſpicuous in our late Troubles, imitated by the Slingers of <hi>Paris;</hi> which is, and ever will be the uſual Method of all who deſign to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a change of Government.</p>
               <p>Therefore wiſe Princes, when they have choſen and had Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Ability and Fidelity of ſuch Miniſters of State, are careful to ſhelter them from the Attacques of the Envious and Ambitious.</p>

               <p>I ſhall only annex to this, what may in general ſerve as a Character of an able and uſeful Miniſter of State, faintly drawn from a great Original.</p>
               <p>Whoever deſigns to ſerve his Prince and Country, in the Adminiſtration of Affairs,<note place="margin">The Method of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State.</note> muſt have had a liberal Education, ſpent a great portion of his time in diligently peruſing Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Modern Hiſtories, Memoires of great men, the Laws and Government of his own and Foreign Countries, and the beſt Treatiſes of Politicks, and then conſider the moſt judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and accompliſhed Perſons; and amongſt them, ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, as in their ſeveral Stations have the Practical Part of Affairs committed to them, both in Courts of Judicature, the Exchequer, and Admiralty; and in theſe eſpecially note their dexterity for their Imployments, wherein their Eminencies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, how their Intereſts are interwoven, or independent; what their diſpoſitions and inclinations are, eſpecially in their obedience to the Government, uſefulneſs to it; their Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, Avarice, Pride, Ambitious or Factious Propenſities; as well prying into the Vices they conceal, as the laudable Qualities they make themſelves conſpicuous by; diſtinguiſhing betwixt the natural and conſtrained tempers of every one.</p>
               <p>If ſuch an one be not <hi>Conſiliarius natus,</hi> he ought to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf early choſen a Member of the Houſe of Commons, and then diligently read all ſuch Books as treat of that Honourable Houſe, peruſe the Journals, note well and weigh, not only what he finds there, but alſo all the Speeches of the leading men, the force of their Arguments, and the tendencies of them: Mark well who are forwardeſt to ſupply the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe Talent lies in contriving wholeſom Laws for the benefit of the Subject, who are the beſt Orators, who the ſubtileſt or ſolideſt, who affect Popularity, who are ſuggeſting ſuſpicions of the increaſe of the Kings Power, who the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt informers of Grievances, who cut the Thred eveneſt betwixt the Royal Prerogative and the Subjects Liberties; in all theſe well pondering the grounds upon which every one bottom their Arguments, contenting himſelf to be an Auditor and Regiſter for ſome while; in his Votes following the wiſeſt and leaſt by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed by private Intereſt.</p>
               <p>During the time he is under the Diſcipline of this Noble School, he muſt fill up the intervals of his vacant hours, either in peruſing ſuch learned Authors as treat of the Subjects have been debated in the Houſe, or in converſation with the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenteſt experienced Members, or with ſuch of the Court as he may be beſt informed from.</p>
               <p>During all which time, he muſt intermingle the Study of the Laws of thoſe Foreign Countries his Prince hath Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with, and obtain true Characters of their Miniſters of State, their regulation of Trade, their Taxes and Gabels, their Military Force, the diſpoſedneſs of any Parties to Faction; and conſider wherein his own Prince, or a Foreigner hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:66310:183"/>Laws for the good Government of the Subjects, and for the preſerving the Crown in Splendor and Power.</p>
               <p>A Perſon thus qualified and fitted for his Maſters Service, and the publick good of his Country, cannot long want an opportunity of being noted; and in peacable times, ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State will be deſirous to obtain his aſſiſtance, and will be ready to befriend him for their own advantages, to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate their own burthens, and his Prince will be deſirous to be ſerved by a Perſon of ſuch a Fund.</p>
               <p>If the times be turbulent and factious, it is not amiſs for ſuch a Perſon (during his Noviceſhip) to mingle himſelf with the popular, and Male-content Nobility; whereby he may know the bottom of their deſigns, and the plauſibleneſs of their Pretences, the ſtrength of their Reaſons, as well as of their party, and the tendencies of the diſtinct Intereſts, that may be united, in rendring the Government ingrateful to the People, though not in the methods of modelling or ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>This, I muſt confeſs, is a dangerous point, and requires one that hath an Heart and Brain all Amulet againſt the infection of Diſloyalty, and is dexterous enough to cajole ſuch a Party; which he may the eaſilier do, by appearing only as a <hi>raſa Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula,</hi> and deſirous of following others conduct, and a well wiſher to his Countrey; and then he ſhall be ſure not to miſs a ſerious courtſhip from that party.</p>
               <p>How then to extricate himſelf from thoſe Thickets, Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Coverts, or Earths, (wherein he hath entred to unken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel the Foxes) will be a great Maſter-piece, and requires no common agility, and deliberate forethought. One of the Houſes of Parliament is the fitteſt Theatre for him to unmask himſelf in, where he may at one great ſtep paſs over to the Loyal ſide: which will be done with more advantage, if he take ſome Critical time, when the ſignalizing his Loyalty will be more uſeful, as well as endearing to his Soveraign; and when Courage and Reſolution will beſt beſtead his Affairs.</p>
               <p>Then he is to diſcover his Talent by demonſtratively mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting his true Zeal for, and juſtifying the Government in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with the faithfuleſt and ableſt Miniſters of State; or putting himſelf in the Van, and without Affectation or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with weighty Reaſons, bold and natural utterance, ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Judgment, and Learning, fully determine the point in debate; and as often as there is occaſion, re-inforce his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with freſh matter.</p>
               <p>Here he is to ſet up his reſt, being reſolved, for his whole life, never to deſert the Intereſt, after he hath upon ſo good deliberation reſolved upon it.</p>
               <p>This Action will ſoon he diſcovered to his Prince, of whoſe Privy-Council (if he were not before) we may ſuppoſe he will ſoon be admitted. Hither he muſt carry a reſolution, fixed and unalterable, to intend ſolely his Maſters Service, and the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:66310:184"/>benefit of his People, that nothing of the Rights of the Crown be diminiſhed, or of the Liberties of the People be invaded. Here no double or ſiniſter dealing muſt enter his thoughts, he muſt be the ſame in his Prince's Cabinet, as at the Council-Board; he muſt uſe a true and dutiful diligence above his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, in attending his Prince's Perſon, and his Councils; muſt be free from unlawful Ambition, Bribery, and By-Ends; all over Oyled, that none may faſten a gripe upon him; be free, debonaire and affable to all he converſeth with; but withal, wholly reſerved as to the diſcovery of his Maſters Deſigns: Ready to prefer none but ſuch as may be truely ſerviceable to their King and Country; culling out, and recommending to his Imployment, only Sober, Diſcreet and Uſeful Perſons, in their ſeveral Capacities, and never ſupporting or countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any that once falſify expectation.</p>
               <p>By the practiſing of all the reſpective qualifications I have (according to my poor Ability) ſet down in this Chapter, and that of the Privy-Council, and thoſe more excellent Methods and Rules his own great Wiſdom will ſuggeſt, he ſhall attain to a great truſt with his Maſter, and a great reſpect and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all the Wiſe and Sober, and ſhall tranſmit a noble Example, and durable Pattern to Poſterity.</p>
               <p>If it ſo fall out, that ſuch a Miniſter of State, cannot in ſome particular Affair conform his Judgment to that of his Collegues, or the Reſolutions of his Prince: It will be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in him, (after the laying open, with all modeſty and ſtrength of Reaſon, the grounds of his Opinion) to ſubmit qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to his Prince's Pleaſure, with that reſignedneſs a Servant doth to a great Maſter, and he will be ſure to reap the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it: For if his Prince, in the Sequel, find his Counſel was ſound, and not ill timed, he will imploy him in greater matters, and with more confidence than before; and if ſuch a Miniſter of State find that he hath been too partial, or byaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his Opinion, he will ſoon find his own errour, and be leſs apt for the future to commit the like.</p>
               <p>However, he is, and ever will be, a true Servant to his Prince, and a good Miniſter of State, who, <hi>ex animo,</hi> and with all poſſible ſincerity, can take as much pleaſure in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Soveraigns Will, when he is laid aſide, as he did in ſerving of him ſo long as he was imployed by him:

                  <p>If any, of what condition ſoever come before them in their Seſſions, with force and Arms, or otherwiſe againſt the Peace, or againſt the Statute thereof made, to diſturb the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Common Law, or to menace the People, that they may not purſue the Law: That they cauſe their Bodies to be Arreſted, and put in Priſon; and if they cannot be Arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the King be certified: That they themſelves, nor others maintain no Plea, or Quarrel hanging in the Kings Court, or elſewhere in the Country: That they deny to no man Common Right by the Kings Letter, nor none other mans, nor for none other Cauſe; and in caſe any other Letters come to them contrary to the Law, they do nothing by ſuch Letters, but certifie the King thereof, and proceed to execute the Law, notwithſtanding any ſuch Letters: That they ſhall procure the profit of the King, and of his Crown, and if in default, ſhall be at the Kings Will, of Body, Lands, and Goods, thereof to be done as ſhall pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p>There is in this Oath as great Security taken,<note place="margin">Obſervations on this Oath.</note> as morally can be, that the Judges perform their Office uprightly, and judge according to the Law; and if this will not make them wary how they give Judgment contrary to Law, there are other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints upon them: As, firſt, That the King may diſplace them when he pleaſes, they holding their Places only <hi>durante bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placito.</hi> Secondly, The Houſe of Commons may queſtion them for any falſe Judgment and Miſcarriage in their Office; which muſt be a great Check and deterring of them from giving any unjuſt Judgment, either for Lucre-ſake by Bribes, or Partiality of Affection.</p>

If they be lett or hindred, they muſt ſhow it to the King; which if they do not, and it come to the Kings knowledg, they ſhall be out of his Favour, as Men out of <hi>Credence,</hi> and put out of Commiſſion for ever.</p>
               <p>Moreover he chargeth and commandeth all manner of Men, as well Poor as Rich (which be to him all one in due Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice) that is hurt or grieved, (in any thing that the ſaid Juſtice of Peace may hear, determine, or execute in any wiſe) that he ſo grieved make his complaint to the next Juſtice of Peace, and if he afford no remedy, then to the Juſtices of the Aſſiſe; and if he find no remedy there, then to the King, or Chancellor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as a further ſecurity it is added, And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that his Highneſs ſhall not lett, for any favour, affection, coſts, charge, nor none other cauſe, but that he ſhall ſee his Laws to have plain and true execution, and his Subjects to live in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Lands, Bodies and Goods, according to his ſaid Laws.</p>

As a cloſe to this Chapter, and an Introduction to the next, I ſhall give a ſhort account of the Laws in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, that were made by ſeveral Kings for the preſervation of the Peace, and of how great value the due keeping of the Peace was.

Fifthly, We may note, that this ſhews that the Militia of the Subjects was at the Kings diſpoſal to go whither then the King will; which ſaves me a labour in the following Chapter to deduce the Kings Power over the Militia higher, though I doubt not but a little looking into the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws would afford me more Precedents, as the Fifty ninth Law of <hi>William the</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bodin</hi> makes this one of the greateſt badges of Soveraignty; becauſe, without the power of declaring War, and making Peace, no Prince can defend himſelf or his Subjects, the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, or Deſtructon of the States depending upon it: therefore it is Capital to do the leaſt thing in that kind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kings Commiſſion.

               <p>As to the King of <hi>England</hi>'s making War, and Peace abroad, it hath always been owned as the King's ſole Prerogative; and when ſome Parliaments have addreſſed to our Kings, to make War or Peace, contrary to what the Soveraign judged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, they have been advertiſed of their Duties: yet when War is to be made in remote Countries, which cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without great Expence, much time, and the exhauſting of the Kingdoms Forces, That the People may more chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve their Prince and Country, and that the Exchequer may not be too much diminiſhed, whereby the uſual Charges of the Government may not be ſubſtracted; Kings have upon good Reaſon, propoſed the Matter to their Parliaments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by neceſſary Aids might be ſufficiently ſupplied.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXVI.</hi> Concerning raiſing of Money upon the Subject, and the obligation of Subjects to ſupply the Soveraign.</head>
               <p>AS to the raiſing of Money for the ſupport of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have diſcourſed ſomething in the Title of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and ſhall here only treat of the neceſſity in all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, That the Soveraign be plentifully ſupplyed with a Revenue ſuitable to the charge.</p>
               <p>Although <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> be reckoned by <hi>Herodotus</hi> one of the firſt that exacted Tribute;<note place="margin">The neceſſity of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Aids.</note> yet it cannot be conceived but that ever ſince there was a Prince who commanded large Countrys, and had potent Neighbours, Tribute, Aid, and ſuch like proviſion was exacted of the people for the defraying the neceſſary charges of it. So <hi>Tacitus</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Nec enim quies gentium ſine armis, nec arma ſine ſtipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis, nec ſtipendia ſine tributis. <hi>4. Hiſt.</hi>
                  </note> tells us, That we may be preſerved in Peace, Arms are neceſſary, and they cannot be provided for without Taxes.</p>
               <p>The Subjects receive the benefit of protection, and by the care of the Government, peaceable poſſeſſion of their Houſes, Fields and Cattle, Liberty of Trade, diſpenſation of Juſtice, and other great Emoluments by its guard and vigilance; which require a numerous retinue of Officers of State, Juſtice, and War, and Multitude of ſubordinate Miniſters. Something alſo
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:66310:204"/>muſt be allowed for the grandeur and port is neceſſary for the regulating it at home and abroad, the maintaining Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence by Ambaſſadors, the providing for defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt foreign Invaſions, and preſerving Tranquillity at home; in all which the Publick is concerned: therefore the reaſon is very juſt, and equitable, that beſides a ſtanding Revenue for defraying theſe conſtant charges, there ſhould be ſubſidiary ſupplys upon emergencies, adequate to the occaſions. As <hi>Cicero</hi> juſtly admoniſheth, <hi>Da operam ut omnes intelligant ſi ſalvi eſſe volunt, neceſſitati eſſe parendum:</hi> That the Subjects be made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that if they will be ſafe,<note place="margin">As the Subject is protected, ſo he ought to ſupport the Government.</note> they muſt yield to neceſſity this abſolute neceſſity of parting with a portion of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, for ſecuring the reſt. For though it be prudence in a private man, juſtly, and moderately to enrich himſelf; yet craftily to withhold from the Publick, and to defraud it of ſuch parts of the Wealth, as is by Law required, is no ſign of prudence (ſaith Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> as judiciouſly as any poſition he lyes down:) but want of knowledge of what is neceſſary,<note place="margin">Civil War.</note> for their own defence, and covetouſneſs to part with nothing they can hold, makes this reſtive humour in many.</p>
               <p>That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have quitted that Soveraign badge of raiſing money upon the Subject, by their own Impoſitions, without conſent of Parliament, is manifeſt ſince <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt's time.<note n="(b)" place="margin">27 E. 1. c. 5. Anno <hi>1299.</hi>
                  </note> The Act for which runs thus, For ſo much as divers Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Realm are in fear, that the Aids and Tasks, which they have given us before time, towards our Wars, and other buſineſs, of their own grant and good will (howſoever they were made) might turn to a Bondage to them and their Heirs, becauſe they might be at another time found in the Rolls, and likewiſe for the prices taken throughout the Realm by our Miniſters: We have granted for us and our Heirs, that we ſhall not draw ſuch Aids, Task nor Prices into a Cuſtom, for any thing that hath been done heretofore, be it by Roll or any other Precedent that may be found.<note n="(c)" place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> The next is thus; Moreover we have granted for us and our Heirs, as well to Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbats, Priors, and other folk of Holy Church, as alſo to Earls, Barons, and to all the Commonalty of the Land; that for no buſineſs from henceforth, we ſhall take ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Aids, Tasks, nor Prices, but by the common aſſent of the Realm, and for the common profit thereof,<note place="margin">See for this the Charter of King <hi>John.</hi>
                  </note> ſaving the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Aids and Prices due and accuſtomed.</p>
               <p>Theſe being not fully enough expreſſed, the Statute of 34. <hi>E.</hi> 1. though as ſhort in words as any to be found, yet is of the largeſt extent, and as liberal a Boon of Royal bounty, as any People can boaſt of from their Prince. It is thus, No Tallage or Aid ſhall be taken or levied by Us, or our Heirs in our Realm, without the good will and aſſent of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Earls, Barons, Knights, Burgeſſes, and other Free-men of the Land. Therefore all thoſe who would enjoy the benefit of this Law, muſt take care they preſerve the Succeſſion and the two Houſes of Parliament.</p>

                  <hi>French</hi> Author, concerning his own Country, makes this objection, That Princes having aſſigned for their uſual charges of the Government, Tribute and other Incomes, they ought to be therewith contented, and not without occaſion raiſe new Taxes to the detriment of the Liege people, and contrary to the intention of the Truſt: Yet he owns this ought to be ſoberly underſtood; for a wiſe Phyſician applies thoſe Remedies neceſſary without the Patient's leave, and will force him, though by cutting off a Limb, to ſave his life. So when there may happen a neceſſity, urgent and unforeſeen, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſuffer no delay, or which ought not for ſome time to be divulged; in ſuch caſes (ſaith he) the King without the States, and whether they will or no, may lay new Impoſitions, and make all other neceſſary proviſions, by the abſolute Power he hath to rule, and preſerve his State and Subjects, he not being able to defend them without neceſſary Forces: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſuch occaſions it is to be ſuppoſed, that with the Power of Government, there is transferred to the Prince the Power to do that, without which good Government cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted; but when there is not that kind of neceſſity, the States are called. Thus far my Author.</p>
               <p>Since therefore<note n="(g)" place="margin">Coke 1. Inſiit. p. 161.</note> 
                  <hi>qui diruit medium, deſtruit finem,</hi> he that takes away the neceſſary means, for a King to preſerve his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in uncommon events, hazards the ruine of the People; ſome have inferred that when dangers ſhould be ſo ſudden, that there could not be time to convene a Parliament, or that ſuch a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament met, ſhould for ſome deſign, deny the Prince Money, then the Kings Prerogative might extend to the raiſing of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and they inſtance in the Loans by Privy Seals, exacted upon the Subjects even in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time.</p>
               <p>This indeed was the Plea for Ship-money, and as the caſe was ſtated by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt,<note place="margin">Concerning Ship-Money.</note> all the Judges once ſubſcribed their affirmative opinions (though Mr. Juſtice <hi>Hutton</hi> and <hi>Crooke</hi> retracted after) and with great learning the caſe was argued, and Judgment given in favour of the King: Yet he hoping, by the yielding to the aboliſhing of it, to have ſtopped the miſery
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:66310:205"/>of a War, conſented to an Act for that purpoſe; yet that prevented not the Inundation of blood: and we found thoſe men, that moved Heaven and Earth with their clamours againſt the King, as governing arbitrarily; when they got the Power, made it their dayly practice, to lay what unprecedented illegal Taxes they pleaſed on their fellow Subjects, to the value, as ſome compute, of Forty Eight Millions.</p>
               <p>Therefore all Judicious perſons, lovers of their King,<note place="margin">The Advantages to Prince and People, when the Crown is liberally provided for.</note> Country and Poſterity, finding the ſad effects thoſe diſputes brought to the Bleſſed King and the whole Kingdom, will think it a neceſſary prudence in a Prince, to have always ſuch a proviſion of Money ready, as will enable him in all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that may occur in the Adminiſtration of the Government, without being obliged to part with any of his Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, when any diſcontented or deſigning Factious Members ſhall be able to take advantage of his Wants, whereby to drive their barter with the Crown; for thereby he ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat their ends. On the other ſide it will be the moſt prudent and dutiful courſe both for their own ſecurity, and the Princes honour, for Parliaments upon all juſt and honourable Wars, or occaſions of aſſiſting Allies, preparing Fleets in readineſs, upon neceſſary defence, to aſſiſt the Prince liberally, and repay out of the Publick, what for publick Service he hath expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his own Revenue, rather than he ſhould be in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem with his Neighbours and Allies; whereby the honour of the Prince, and conſequently of his Subjects, ſhould be Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or he be neceſſitated to take any unuſual courſe for raiſing Money, or be compelled to make any inglorious Peace: for we can never forget, how the want of ſupplies to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, brought not only Ship-money, and Knight-hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Monopolies, and the long diſuſe of Parliaments, but at laſt that moſt calamitous War upon the whole Nation.</p>
               <p>We cannot forget how zealous an Houſe of Commons was of late to prevent any Arbitrarineſs, as it was inſinuated,<note place="margin">

So that they would give nothing themſelves, but as much as in them lay, terrified o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from lending, or advancing any Money to him; which was not according to their Writ, to adviſe, but by dureſs
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:66310:206"/>and force to compel the King to ſubmit to their Judgments: and inſtead of giving him Aſſiſtance to ſupport his Allies, and enable him to preſerve <hi>Tangier,</hi> they tended to the diſenabling him from contributing to either by his own Revenue and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; not only expoſing him to the dangers that might happen either at home or abroad, but endeavouring to deprive him of the Poſſibility of ſupporting the Government it ſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to a more helpleſs Condition than the meaneſt of his Subjects, as the King ſadly and juſtly complained; and in that Vote the Subjects Liberty and Property was invaded, in that he could not diſpoſe of his Money to his own Profit, and the Benefit of the Government, if either Inſurrection or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion happened in the interval of Parliament, or a foreign Force on a ſudden ſhould attacque us: yet theſe Gentlemen would be counted Loyal and Dutiful Subjects.</p>
               <p>It is not to be denyed, but that if a Prince's ſtanding Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue were ſo great, that by it he might not only ſupport the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary expences of the Government, but lay by a ſumm ſufficient to defray all extraordinary incident Charges, either occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by inteſtine Rebellions, or foreign Invaſions; that a King ſhould not have occaſion to have ſo often recourſe to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Aids.</p>
               <p>Yet when we confider, that there would be many other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of frequent convening that great Council, for making wholeſom Laws, which is one great Portion of their Buſineſs; and that the Subjects never can be happy under a poor Prince, who thereby ſhould be brought into contempt, and how much greater miſchiefs accrue to the Subjects, by rendring their Prince impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and unable to preſerve them from factious diſturbers of their Peace and Repoſe, and the preſerving their Properties, as well as the defending them from the deſigns of foreign Princes who would injure our Merchants, lock us in our Iſland, and force us to ſell our own native Commodities, and receive theirs at what Rates they pleaſed, if our Soveraign were not able to keep a ſufficient Fleet, and infinite other Miſchiefs, which would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a ſtarved Exchequer; we ſhould too late find that the Expence of many Millions would not again reſtore us to that condition of Proſperity and Renown, that one, timely beſtowed on our Prince, would preſerve us in. It is much leſs Charge to keep in good Repair, a well-built Fort, Caſtle, or Man of War, than to build a new one, eſpecially if, upon the demoliſhing of the old, we were to fight for the Ground and Materials, whereupon and wherewith we ſhould build the new.</p>
               <p>It is a ſingular Security to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject, that no Money can be levied upon him, but by Act of Parliament, to which in his Repreſentatives he gives his Conſent: and the Houſe of Commons is generally careful that they underſtand a great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, ere they paſs any Money-bill; yet we have known in our Age ſome, that have ſtood upon ſuch terms with their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:66310:206"/>that either he hath choſen rather to want Supplies, than have them upon ſuch hard Terms, or their Principals have ſuffered a thouſand times more by ſuch denials, than they had done if they had been granted.</p>
               <p>So was <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> loſt to the <hi>Turks,</hi> for want of furniſhing the Emperor with the hundredth part of that which the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Enemy plundered the Citizens of; and ſo the Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, elected King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> loſt that Kingdom, and all his Hereditary Seigniories, by unfurniſhing his Soldiers with preſent Pay, when he had it by him. And how many ſuffer by the want of a liberal and proportionable Supply, to pay off the Debts of the Exchequer, is too ſadly felt by many; and if the Parliament of 1639. had furniſhed King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt with twelve Subſidies (as it appears by the ſequel,) the Expence of four times as many Millions, beſides the infinite quantity of Chriſtian Blood ſhed in the enſuing War, had been prevented in all humane probability.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is to be hoped that both Parliaments will be careful to ſupply the wants of the Crown; and Princes will for the future, be as careful ſo to imploy the Monies given, that they may encourage their Subjects (as often as the urgency of Affairs may require it) to give freely what may be uſeful, and ſufficient for their Kings urgent occaſions.</p>

This <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh did, and though they continued Loyal to him, yet they did not co-operate with him in his Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of State, that we may preſume, ſwayed with ſo wiſe a King, was, for that the Wars betwixt the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> had been carried on by the ſidings of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who had in thoſe Days numerous Retinues; the younger Sons of the Gentry, and ſometimes the elder, making a great part of the vaſt Families of Noblemen, and their Tenents hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Lands by ſmall Rents, and due Service, enabled them to make great alterations in the State, accordingly as the chief of the Nobility were combined.

               <p>In all Ages likewiſe ſome of the ancient Nobility are extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and it is fit to plant new Standards in the room of the decayed: So that what theſe Learned Men aſſert concerning ſpare Diſtribution of Honours, is to be conſidered with juſt Limitations.</p>

No ſooner was that ſacred Head ſeparated from them, but they were degraded to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners (as to any Legiſlative Power:) and though thoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen that were content to fit in the lower Houſe, were highly careſſed and applauded; yet a few Years hath changed the note, and their Names will be recorded to Poſterity, in far leſs Luſtre than if they had more ſtrenuouſly eſpouſed the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Kings Quarrel: and it is not to be doubted, but the Sence of that will be a moſt prevalent Antidote againſt the Defection of any of the Nobility, that will conſider the naturalneſs of ſuch a degrading, if the Commonwealth-Men ſhould ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear again without their Vizors; and it will be an excellent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulet to keep them from the Infection of ſuch Principles and Practice.</p>
               <p>It is worth noting, that <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror giving to his Nobility great Fees to be held of him in <hi>Capite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How the Nobility had greater Power anciently than now.</note> for ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Nobility had great Intereſts, and numerous dependences, and had ſpecial Jurisdiction over great Baronies; and while they ſerved the Crown according to their Tenures, the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Gentry and Commoners being one way or other Tenents to them, could do little in oppoſition to the Crown. But when in King <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's time, their greatneſs was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Crown, the Commons were brought in to be a part of the Parliament. Yet for ſome while after they retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Grandeur, till (as I have hinted) <hi>Henry</hi> 7. retrenched them, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> preferring ſo many new Men, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs uſe of the ancient Nobility, ſtudied to gain the common Peoples Affections by all Arts and Bounties ſhe could uſe: and in after-Ages the Nobility being leſs valued by the Freeholders, and encreaſed in Number, and ſome of them adhering to the two Houſes againſt their Sovereign, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts both with the Parliament and People grew leſs.</p>
               <p>But now under a Prince who ſets a true value upon the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, if they he not wanting to themſelves, they may hope to attain the luſtre of their noble Anceſtors, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be no ways abridged of their Priviledges. For then the Government is in the happieſt Condition, when the Nobility are great without Ambition, rich without Oppreſſion, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in Vertue as in Character. The Gentry ſo deporting themſelves to the Commonalty as they deſire the Nobility may to them; and the Commonalty with humble Induſtry,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:66310:210"/>peaceably enriching themſelves, and enjoying that freedom and liberty, which may keep them in Heart and Courage to ſerve their Prince and Country with chearful Alacrity, and out-do thoſe of their Rank in all other Dominions; which in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Soldiery is obſerved in all Wars to be their peculiar Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, aſcribable principally to the Benignity of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which diſpirits them not: and when this liberty is not abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Licentiouſneſs, but reſtrained within the Bounds of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Candor and Modeſty, Reverence to their Superiors, and thankfulneſs to their Prince; all is in an happy Frame.</p>

               <p>Remember I beſeech you (dear Countrymen) theſe things, and conſider how near the Gulph and Pits Brink of inevitable Miſeries you were. Be thankful to thoſe Loyal Perſons, who by their Counſels and Addreſſes withheld you from the imminent Ruine. Be miſ-led no more by ſuch as can ſow nothing but Darnel, Cockle, Poppy and Tares among your Corn; would conſume your Grain, and leave you nothing but the Chaff. Such as by inſtigating you to Inſurrections, under Pretence of Religion, or any other Wheedles, would neceſſitate the Government for your own Security, to rule you with a Scepter of Iron; whereas now you are under one of pure Gold, beſet with all the Jewels of Heroic Vertue.</p>
               <p>Would you avoid the Slavery of the <hi>French</hi> Commoners, and be never in danger of being Peaſants? Would you enjoy what you and your happy Fore-fathers have done in peaceable times? Then ſtudy your Duty of Obedience to the Laws, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all Murmurings, and Repinings, heartily pray for the King's Proſperity, heartily endeavour to ſerve him with your Lives and Fortunes againſt his Enemies; live quietly under his careful and merciful Conduct; adore that divine Providence that hath eſtabliſhed him peaceably in his Throne, and out of infinite Compaſſion to theſe Nations, hath prevented a Civil War.</p>
               <p>Be ſincerely and cordially thankful that you are under the Government of ſuch a Prince, who ſo freely and ſpontaneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſeth to defend your Religion, ſecure your Properties, and adventure his Perſon for your Defence: Who is juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced abroad, ought to be as entirely honoured, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately loved, and dutifully obeyed at home. So ſhall the Government be Eaſy, Beneficial and Merciful to you; ſo ſhall you have full Barns and Purſes, and all the Bleſſings of Peace and Security in the long Enjoyment of them.</p>

If the Government hath injured me, I ought to take it as the injuries of the Weather, not to rage and fret at it.

But when they ſee their Paſſions are not only pitied or cheriſhed, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded; it is a thouſand to one, they never recover out of their diſtemper, or not to be ſure, till they, or the Publick have ſmarted for their folly, and thoſe who have careſſed the deviliſh humor in them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Emulous Perſons (who can neither endure equals,<note place="margin">7.

               <p>Before I come to treat of the Prognoſticks of the Miſchiefs of Factions, I muſt take notice of two of the certaineſt, moſt demonſtrative, and dangerous ſigns of Faction running up to Seed that can be, and thoſe are Tumultuous Petitioning and Tumults.</p>
               <p>Theſe will the better be illuſtrated, both ſeparately and in conjunction,<note place="margin">The Method the Long Parliament u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> by laying open the Methods the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment took to effect their deſigns againſt their Gracious King. Firſt, With great ſhew of Compaſſion and Commiſeration for their fellow Subjects ſufferings, they eagerly debate the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, which by a correſpondence betwixt the Members of the Houſe of Commons, and their Friends in the Country, by Petitions, many thouſands ſtrong, were daily repreſented to them, every one ſtriving to be foremoſt in repreſenting, and outſtrip his Neighbour in exaggerating the Grievances (as they called them) that they lay under. In theſe Petitions to the Houſes (but moſtly to the Houſe of Commons) were Bead-rolls of Complaints againſt the oppreſſion of the Subject, both by the Kings Council, Preſident, and Eccleſiaſtical Courts, the Star-Chamber, High Commiſſion Court, the Judges counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing exorbitant Power, that the Property and Liberty of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:66310:221"/>the Subject was invaded by Monopolies, Ship-money, Knight-hood-money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> illegal Sentences in the Star-Chamber, the Innovations of the Biſhops, their ſeverity againſt pious Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, and People of peaceable and tender Conſciences, as they called them; and the baſer ſort of the People were permitted, or rather invited to come to the Parliament-Houſe, to back theſe ſtrong Petitions.</p>
               <p>By this Artifice, they expoſed the Government to obloquy and contempt among the People, and raiſed in them a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Opinion that their only Redreſs was to be hoped from the Parliament, and ſo brought themſelves into a popular eſteem, by ſo much more looſening the Peoples Affections, and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the King, by ſo much as they faſter knit the Peoples Hearts and Hands to their Repreſentatives, uſing all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to make the Subjects believe they were the only Patriots and Liberators.</p>
               <p>They paſs Votes conformable to the Petitioners deſire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate them to ſearch for more, and eſpecially to fix them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Perſons they were mindful to remove out of places of truſt. Then they begun to impeach ſeveral Miniſters of State, and the Judges, that they might weaken the King in his Councils, and terrifie others into compliance: always taking care to charge the miſdeeds upon the Kings evil Counſellors, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Kings Natural Goodneſs, and declaring, That if he would conſent to redreſs thoſe Grievances, and to puniſh the Authors, they would make him a richer and more glorious King, than any of his Predeceſſors. Seditious<note n="(t)" place="margin">

                  </note> Pamphlets daily came out, and the Printing-Preſs laboured Night and Day to abuſe the King and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and bring the Government, Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, into obloquy. Their Preachers in the mean time, like ſo many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues, plied their buſineſs ſo effectually, blowing the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet as they phraſed it, for the Lord and <hi>Gideon,</hi> that by them the Houſes Intereſt prevailed every where, eſpecially in the Populous City, which was in a manner wholly at the Houſes devotion.</p>
               <p>Having removed the Great and Noble Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> by great Induſtry and Art, and the Midwifery of Tumults, and got themſelves (by as ſtrange an Art as overſight) perpetuated, they ſet themſelves to Remonſtrate; in which they odiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all the miſcarriages (as they called them) in the Bleſſed Kings Reign, charging him (though covertly) with them, and all the very Misfortunes of his Reign. They revive the Bill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Biſhops ſitting in the Houſe of Lords, which had been rejected, and in a Parliamentary way ought not again to be ſet on foot that Seſſion; the better to effect which, they cauſe the Rabble and their Confederates to menace and aſſault them, and other Loyal Members of the Houſe; they Poſt up ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral names of Lords and Commons, who oppoſed their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and having driven the King, and his whole Family away by

                  </note> much as every one was forwarder in boldneſs, and more hardy, by ſo much the more he was to be confided in, and ſitter to help forward the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent work they were about.</p>
               <p>Having firſt got the Peoples affections to revere them as their Deliverers, they the more eaſily obtained their Bodies, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and Moneys, and ſo proſecuted a Rebellious War open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet with that ſhameful pretence, that they were fighting for the King againſt his Evil-Counſellors, and, amongſt hands, court him with moſt Dethroning Propoſitions: and ſucceſs Crowning their arms, they wholly deſtroyed that Monarchy they had all along pretended to eſtabliſh upon ſurer founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Honour of the Crown, and benefit of the People, than former Ages had known. Inſtead of which, they made themſelves Maſters of all their Fellow-Subjects, ſeizing their Eſtates, Impriſoning and Murthering their Perſons; altering the eſtabliſhed Eccleſiaſtical Government, and all the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws, enriching themſelves, and over-awing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by a ſtanding Army.</p>
               <p>Thus I have drawn that in Miniture, which was the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of many Years, and the Subject of numerous Volumes, and I ſhall tack to it ſomething parallel in later Years, to let all Poſterity ſee what a Characteriſtick Mark it is of Turbulent and Factious Inclinations, when Petitions againſt the Will of the Government are violently promoted.</p>
               <p>The great miſchief of tumultuous Petitions being conſidered by the Loyal Parliament,<note place="margin">The Act againſt Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Petitions.</note> upon the late Glorious King's happy Reſtauration, Proviſion was made, that the number of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers of Petitions ſhould not exceed ten; that three of the Juſtices of Peace in the County, or the major part of a Grand Jury at an Aſſize, or General Seſſions; or in <hi>London,</hi> the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council have the ordering, and conſent to ſuch Petitions, which ſhall be for alteration of things eſtabliſhed by Law, in Church or State, by way of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, Complaint, Remonſtrances, Declaration, or other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the King, or either Houſes of Parliament.</p>
               <p>It cannot be forgot (in the interval of a later Parliament) how zealous and buſy multitudes were to get Petitions with Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and Thouſands of Hands, to the late King for the ſitting of a Parliament, before the King in his Wiſdom thought ſit.
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:66310:222"/>This occaſioned the King to iſſue forth a Proclamation againſt tumultuous Petitions, and other Loyal Perſons to expreſs an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of ſuch Petitions, that would preſs the King to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate their Sitting.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that petitioned the King for convening of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could not but foreſee the ungratefulneſs of ſuch Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the King; yet the Deſigners gave it not over: for they had other Ends. As firſt, to engage Men by their Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be more faſt to them: Secondly to try whether the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be brought to Tumults: Thirdly to incenſe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more againſt the Government, if their Petitions were denied: Fourthly to ſhew <hi>in terroreon,</hi> the number of their Adherents: Fifthly, That through every County the confiding and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous might be known each to other: and Laſtly, that whenever that Parliament ſhould ſit, they might have their Thanks, and by their Numbers the Parliament might be encouraged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in ſuch things as they deſired, knowing hereby the Strength of the Party.</p>
               <p>When the Houſe of Commons met, nothing was ſo much clamoured againſt, as the Proceedings upon the late Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as if all the Liberties of the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in this. Therefore they vote that it ever hath been the undoubted Right of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the Votes.</note> to Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the King, for the Calling, and Sitting of Parliaments, for redreſſing of Grievances; and to traduce ſuch Petitioning, was a violation of Duty; and to repreſent it to his Majeſty as tumultuous, and Seditious, was to betray the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and contribute to the deſign of ſubverting the Legal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Conſtitution of the Kingdom, and introducing Arbitrary Power, and ſo a Committee (called of Abhorrence) was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to enquire of all ſuch Perſons as had offended againſt the Rights of the Subjects.</p>
               <p>This was it that explained their Vote, for all the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy was, Whether a ſew private Men might agree upon a Petition, then ſend Emiſſaries abroad to procure the Subſcriptions, and then tender them, as it were by their number to affright the King to a Compliance; or that the King (to whom the Execution of the Laws, or ſuſpenſion in ſome meaſure ſurely appertains) might not forbid ſuch Petitions.</p>
               <p>They ſingled out Sir <hi>Francis North,</hi> then Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Common-Pleas, after Lord Keeper, and Earl of <hi>Guilford,</hi> Sir <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> then Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> now Lord Chancellor, Mr. Juſtice <hi>Withins,</hi> and others, as Subjects of their diſpleaſure, for diſliking, and abhorring the irregular dangerous way of Petitioning. But they received more Luſtre and Regard in the Eyes of their Soveraign, and all Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by their Cenſure, than they did diſcredit by it. It ſeems worth the while for Perſons that have regard to the quiet and repoſe of the Subject, to the Honour and Eſtabliſhment of the Government, and for the Tranquillity and Liberty of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:66310:223"/>to conſider, whether any mortal Man can either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Precedent or Law to juſtify the Impriſonment of thoſe Gentlemen Abhorrers; of which I have ſpoken ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Chapter of Parliaments.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now conclude with the laſt and formidableſt ſign of Sedition,<note place="margin">Of Tumults.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Tumults, which are but unarmed, and Pen-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Rebellion. They have the Mien and Standard of it, only want the Artillery. The fatal black Parliament diſciplined them to be ready at any watch word, and whatever they voted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King or Church, was uſhered in by thouſands of all ſorts, flocking out of the City and Country, braving and threatning all along as they went by <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and ſo in Sholes crowding to the Houſes, promiſing to ſtand by them, and crying out for Juſtice. They were ſo inſolent and rude, that they forced the Merciful King to withdraw from his Pallace, to which he never returned, till they brought him to his Barbarous Tryal and Murther.</p>
               <p>That Bleſſed Kings Sence of them can be expreſſed by none ſo emphatically as by himſelf; therefore I ſhall extract ſome of his feeling Expreſſions.</p>

Thoſe who had moſt mind to bring forth Confuſion and Ruin, upon Church and State, uſed the Midwifery of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, by which they ripped up with barbarous Cruelty, and forcibly cut out abortive Votes, to crowd in by force, what reaſon would not lead. Some Mens Petulancy was ſuch, as they joyed to ſee their Betters ſhamefully and outragiouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed. So the Bleſſed King finding they invaded the Honour and Freedom of the two Houſes, and uſed ſuch contemptuous words and Actions againſt him, thought himſelf not bound by his Preſence to provoke them to higher Contempt and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For he ſaith it was an hardineſs beyond Valour to ſet himſelf againſt the breaking in of the Sea; being daily bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Tumults, he knew not whether their Fury and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent might not fly ſo high, as to worry him, and tear him to pieces, whom as yet they played but with in their Paws: Therefore thinks himſelf not bound to proſtitute the Majeſty of his Place and Perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to thoſe who inſult moſt when they have Objects, and opportunity moſt capable of their rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and petulancy.</p>
               <p>Our late gracious Sovereign in later times, when ſome Men were endeavouring to practiſe the ſame Methods, found ſome offers of the like at <hi>Windſor</hi> (a place of all others, in which one would have thought he ſhould have had the moſt Honour for the Benefits he did to that Town by his ſo frequent reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) when firſt the Boys, and then the Rabble were ſet on

               <p>The Prophetick Obſervation of the Martyred King is worth noting, That he believes the juſt Avenger of all Diſorders, will in time make theſe Men, and that City, ſee their Sin in the Glaſs of their Puniſhment: which needs no application, but only to deſire they would be ſo juſt to themſelves and their Poſterity, as to follow no ſuch Precedents, and that none will encourage ſuch outragious doings.</p>

               <p>AS no Malady in the natural Body can be cured without the knowledg of the proper cauſes; ſo the prevention, of the growth of Faction and Sedition unto Rebellion, is beſt effected by ſubſtracting the matter, and taking away the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental cauſes of it.</p>

So beginning Ulcers are eaſilier cured, than thoſe that are feſtered to the Bone, or are Callous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulas.</p>
               <p>Sedition is a perſonal Crime; but becauſe it conſiſts in the ſeveral qualifications of the Perſons, I ſhall treat of the Cure in the ſame method as I have of the Cauſers and Cauſes. The ſigns being as ſo many Symptoms, which will require alſo ſome remarks.</p>
               <p>Firſt as to the debauched,<note place="margin">1. The Debauched.</note> they are but the <hi>Velites,</hi> the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed Vancouriers, there is ſmall danger from them. They grow as Tares in every Country and Age, they are the luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant branches of a rank Soil and long peace; They are the Sutlors of the Camp: There is a curſe of peace that brings ſuch weeds, but the Howes of the Laws and Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline will hinder their growth, and eradicate them.</p>
               <p>The beſt Antidote againſt the miſchiefs theſe people can
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:66310:225"/>bring to the Common-weal, is the Prince's example to put vice out of faſhion and countenance; for a Prince's Vertue and Piety influenceth much.</p>
               <p>No doubt his Majeſtie's great care to forbid and diſcredit all kinds of Vice, will work a greater<note n="(c)" place="margin">Hac conditio Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipum, ut quicquid fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam, pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Light-Headed.</note> as they are ſomething a kin to the debauched (the one pleaſing his ſenſual Appetite, and the other feeding the Chimaeras of his Brain, as their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Province) ſo they are as little dangerous. The ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Libels and Pamphlets would ſtarve them. But if they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, it is likely they would be worſe imployed; Therefore it is neceſſary in all Governments, to countenance and ſet on work ingenious Perſons, who are well principled to the State, to ridicule the Factious, and feed theſe flutterers of the Air with Canary-ſeed; and they will never fly againſt the wind, or out of their Aviary, but there ſport themſelves with as much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of hopes, flights and ſhort Notes, as the Birds do; and yet other mortals be as ignorant of the impulſive cauſes, as we are of the motives of the frisks and flutters of thoſe Choriſters of the Air.</p>
               <p>However theſe are not to be countenanced and indulged, leſt their wild Notes be imitated, or that airineſs grow too faſhionable, whereby ſolidity and ſtayedneſs be ridicul'd; as we have ſeen it too much in our age, when the Military educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation made the Schools and Univerſities leſs frequented, and the licentiouſneſs of thoſe times is not yet forgot.

                  <hi>Neceſſitas ad turpe cogit,</hi> Robbing and Stealing are their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter exploits in times of Peace.

               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:66310:226"/>
               <p>The way to enrich a People in general, is to open and well ballance Trade, cheriſh all ſort of Manufacture, baniſh Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, repreſs waſts and exceſs, improve and husband the Soil, regulate all things vendable, moderate Taxes and Tributes, to invite the Indigent to people new Plantations, or thoſe that are fit for it, to ſerve abroad in Military imployments.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſuch Remedies, as being vigorouſly put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will leave few in want, but ſuch as by their lazineſs will chuſe to freeze on Horſeback, rather than take the pains to go on foot to get them heat.</p>
               <p>A Prince that would enrich his Subject (ſaith my<note n="(e)" place="margin">Eſſays.</note> Lord St. <hi>Albans</hi>) muſt take care that the Treaſure of money in the State, be not gathered into few hands; otherwiſe a State may have a great ſtock and yet ſtarve: Money being like Dung, not uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unleſs ſpread.</p>
               <p>The beſt Mine above ground is when a Country affords not only the Commodity, but the Manufacture and carriage; for then treble hands are ſet on work. Thence in all projects of cutting Rivers, for the tranſporting of Commodities further within Land, it ought to be well conſidered, whether it be not more profitable, to have many poor men and their Cattle imployed in Land carriage, than by the cheaper way of Water only, to enrich the Tradeſmen, and ſtarve a hundred heads for one.</p>
               <p>If the wholſom Laws for ſetting on work, and relieving the Poor by the labour of their own hands, and forcing ſturdy Beggars and idle Vagabonds to work, or be confined to their own Pariſhes, were ſtrictly put in Execution, we ſhould have leſs reaſon to complain of them.</p>
               <p>It is true it is not from the poor and lazy that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo much in danger; for thoſe are not fitted for Souldiers. It is the ſpirited poor that have ſpirits above their fortunes, or by living above their income, have waſted their Eſtates, that are Inſtruments fit to be made uſe of by the Factious; yet their numbers are not ſo great, but vigilant Magiſtrates may have an eye upon them, and the Government may imploy the ableſt of them in collecting the Revenue. Others may be made inferior Officers in the Militia, and the reſt muſt be left to better huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand what they have remaining, and kept in hopes that if they pay due reſpect to the Government, at one time or other they may be provided for: and the Loyal Gentry may find ways to oblige them in their Services; ſo that every one that is fit to be made good uſe of, may by one way or other be ſet to gain a better livelyhood, than they are like to get by ſantring and flandring the Government; which if they do, ſome ſevere Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion may amend them, or deter others.</p>
               <p>It is not poſſible that the Government can provide for all the Indigent, without ſtrict execution of the Laws. But the care of the Juſtices of Peace, injoyned by the Soveraign, may do much good; however they may keep ſuch from moleſting the Government.</p>

               <p>Ambitious men are the Field-Officers and Brigadeers of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and by ſo much as they are commonly perſons of Birth and Parts, they the more require a Prince's regard above all other Factious perſons.</p>
               <p>If they find (ſaith my Lord St. <hi>Albans</hi>) the way open to their riſing, they are rather buſy than dangerous; but if they be checked and ſtopped, like ill humours they grow Malignant.

               <p>Therefore it is good for Princes if they uſe ambitious men, ſo to handle the matter, as they be ſtill progreſſive; which becauſe it cannot be without inconvenience, it is good not to uſe ſuch natures at all: for if they riſe not with their Maſters ſervice, they will take care to make their ſervice fall with them.</p>
               <p>There is leſs danger <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> of ambitious men, if they be of mean Birth, than if Noble; and if they be new rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, rather than grown cunning, and fortified in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>It is leſs danger (ſaith the ſame great Chancellor<note n="(g)" place="margin">Idem.</note> whoſe wiſe obſervations on this head I cannot omit) to have an ambitious man ſtirring in buſineſs, than great in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. He that ſeeks to be eminent amongſt able men, hath a great task, but ſuch as is ever good for the Publick; but he that plots to be the only figure amongſt Cyphers, is the decay of a whole Age.</p>
               <p>Princes may make uſe of Ambitious men in pulling down the greatneſs of any Subject that over-tops, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> uſed <hi>Macro</hi> in pulling down <hi>Sejanus.</hi> Alſo they make uſe of them as Screens in matters of danger and envy: But no man will take that office, unleſs he be a ſeeled Dove, that mounts and mounts, becauſe he cannot ſee about him.</p>
               <p>Commanders in Wars, though Ambitious, are uſeful; for their Service diſpenſeth with the reſt: and to take a Souldier without it, is to pull off his Plumes and his spurs.</p>
               <p>Favourites are remedies againſt ambitious great ones, and they are well corrected alſo, by ballancing them by others as proud as themſelves: but then there muſt be ſome middle Counſellors to keep them ſteddy; for without that Ballaſt the Ship will roll too much.</p>

               <p>Theſe, and ſuch like, may be the cures of Ambitious Men, while they are of the Council of Princes, on Miniſters of State. But when they want Imployment, and are tainted in their Principles, or entertain deſigns of altering the State, or by the unboundedneſs of their aſpirings, aim at the ſole direction of Affairs, and care not what miſchiefs befall their Prince, or Country in the purſuit of their Deſigns; a Prince ſhould look upon them as in the next degree of moſt dangerous Traitors.</p>
               <p>In this caſe a Prince hath but two ways, either to ſet wiſe men to work, who cambring them to their Service, and make them ſenſible, that their advantage will be greater by ſtudying the Service of their Prince in conſort with other experienced Stateſmen, than by heading of any Faction againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and letting them ſee by the many examples in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, how unproſperous it hath been to all that have ſtriven to wreſt Honours and Employments from their Prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proportionable Service: That they are not to preſume to be wiſer than the Government: That Kings have long Hands, can reach Malefactors at a great diſtance, and unprovided: how unable they are to vie with Majeſty; and make them ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that never any durable Renown or Wealth was got by courting the People, in oppoſition to the Prince; and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Juſtneſs of the Government in ſuch Particulars as they moſt quarrel at. And if this will not bring them to their right Senſes, then either ſend them abroad, or give them ſome tickliſh Employment at home, wherein, if their Ambition tempt them to outdo their Commiſſion, they may be run into a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> whereby they may be cruſhed at once.</p>
               <p>Still a Prince hath a difficult task how to comport himſelf, to caſt off Miniſters of State, who having been accuſtomed to be very leading, and much credited in Councils, have been imployed in great and weighty Affairs, got themſelves great Eſtates, and Dependences. If ſuch (upon ſome Reaſons the Prince beſt knows to himſelf) be ſoftly to be laid aſide, whereby his Partiſans may be induced to believe, it was for no Guilt, but to make room for others advancement; a Prince is in danger to have his Affairs much obſtructed by them.</p>
               <p>For theſe (upon every ill ſucceeding Affair of State after their removal) will ſuggeſt to the People, the evil tendency of it; and they ſhall be ſure to have their repute for Judgment and forecaſt much valued by the People, becauſe it was ſo once by the Prince: and ſo the vulgar inſtantly credit his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents as Oracles; ſo that he having already acquired an eaſy belief, with the greateſt facility in the World, puts a falſe gloſs upon the Princes beſt deſigned Actions, and retaining his old dependences, they will whiſperingly diſperſe his ſence of things.</p>
               <p>Let him then make himſelf heads of the Country Party, and the true Proteſtants (as of late ſome affected to be called) and he is preſently without further labour and induſtry adored as
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:66310:227"/>the Peoples prime Patriot. Having got Tools enough to work with, ſtill pretending his concern for the Publick weal of the People, and at the ſame time, tacitly inſinuating ſome reflections upon his <hi>Quondam</hi>-fellow Counfellors, depreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating their Wiſdom, and Honeſty, and leaves the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Admirers: They will be ſure to aggravate all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Male-Adminiſtration (ſince his laying aſide, and inſinuate that Affairs have a tendency to oppreſſion of the People, altering Religion, or ſuch like plauſible Subjects; and ſo by little and little the Peoples affections will be eſtranged from their Prince, and ſhall be ſet upon this new Idol, the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len <hi>Lucifer.</hi>

               <p>If the Soveraign upon ſome emergences by neceſſitated to call a Parliament, he ſhall obtain a great, if not a major part of the Members, choſen (according to the Common Peoples by as, he ſhall put upon them) moſt oppoſite to the Kings In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. In ſuch an Aſſembly he ſhall be ſure to have great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and under ſome pretences of Grievances of the Subject, render uſeleſs to the Affairs of the Soveraign, and upon its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary diſſolution, improve ſtill his Intereſt, that the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parliament ſhall be as wayward; and by promoting Bills, he knows his Soveraign can neither in Honour or Conſcience aſſent to, ſtill more alienate the Peoples affections from him, till at laſt he get to be ſole Director of ſuch Aſſemblies; having all this while the Wiſdom and cunning to keep himſelf within the compaſs, and reſerve, that for Words or Actions he be not obnoxious to the Laws.</p>
               <p>Having obtained this height, he is able to influence the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected of City Magiſtrates, ſecure himſelf by them, and at laſt to form Conſpiracies againſt his Prince; till which time, he being the Idol of the People, is only feared and ſuſpected: but nothing of Traiterous Deſigns being yet pregnantly diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he runs on his risk till ſome fortunate diſcovery of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns force him to abſcond, and then his whole machinations come to light; and if he eſcape the hand of Juſtice, he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave his Countrey, and ends his life ingloriouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
               <p>This is the common exit of ſuch, who had much better have offered violence to theſe headſtrong Paſſions, and been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a quiet retreat, and dieted and phyſicked their viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſtempers with the applications of ſage Counſel, and the Precepts of Judicious Men, finding out the cure for their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes in Books, and Solitude; than thus to live in the Pangs and Throes of Ambition, to the diſquiet of their Prince, and the emptying of their Country.</p>

So the carrying great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a plain and open manner without Arrogance, and Vain-glory, doth demoliſh Envy. Therefore the wiſe ſort of great Perſons ever bring upon the Stage ſomebody, upon whom to derive the Envy, which otherwiſe would fall upon themſelves.</p>
               <p>Perſons of eminent Vertues,<note place="margin">Id.</note> when they are advanced, are leſs envied: for their Fortune ſeemeth but due to them, eſpecially if they be of noble Blood, being that much is not added to their Fortune; ſo thoſe advanced by degrees, are leſs envied than thoſe <hi>per ſaltum.</hi>

               <p>Theſe are not the Envies that are ſo perilous to States, for that they are terminated on particular Perſons only; but that Envy which is dangerous to a State, is when it is great upon the Miniſters of State, when the<note n="(u)" place="margin">Dolendi modus, ti mendi non item.</note> Cauſes of it, eſpecially, are ſmall, and the Fear greater than the Feeling; for that ſhews the Envy raiſed upon Deſign, and to be general upon all, or moſt of the Miniſters: and then however it may be diſguiſed, it is upon the State it ſelf.</p>
               <p>It is this kind of Envy that principally forebodes Miſchief, and requires greater Skill and Dexterity in the Prince, and his Miniſters, to avoid the Malignity of the Blaſt of theſe black Souls, and the Sting of ſuch Aſps, Vipers, and Scorpions.</p>

               <p>As to Corporations, they have all of them been endowed with their Privileges by the Grace and Bounty of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, from whence all Immunities and Honours do flow. The firſt Inſtitution of them was, no doubt,<note place="margin">Concerning Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</note> that Juſtice might be executed in them, for the better governing their numerous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; that they might be the Places of Traffick, where the adjacent Country might be ſupplied, and their Neighbours might vend their Growth and Manufacture. And thus being enriched by Commerce, ſeparated from their Country-Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by Honours, Offices, and Liberties; ſomething a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiler Education might be expected there, whereby they might be Patterns to their adjoyning Neighbours of good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deportment, being exempted from the Juriſdiction of the Juſtices of Peace, and attendance upon Aſſizes, whereby Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Matters, in order to the neceſſary Adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, are executed in their Precincts, by their own Members; and many of them (beſides the Privileges to be found at large in the Statutes and Law-Books) have power to chuſe as many to repreſent them in Parliament, as the whole County hath. It would fill a large Volume, to recount the particular Powers and Freedoms have been granted to them by the Royal Favour of the ſucceſſive Kings of <hi>England,</hi> whereby they are erected into little Commonwealths.</p>
               <p>Therefore there is good reaſon, as they may do much good
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:66310:232"/>or harm, and they have all the enriching Streams and Conduits from the Sovereign Spring and Fountain; ſo they ſhould have a ſtrict dependence upon the Sovereign, that they may not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy thoſe great Privileges againſt the Laws and Government; nor the rich pragmatical Magiſtrates, Citizens, and Freemen, animate Factions and Seditions againſt it; or preſume to obtrude their impertinent Advices upon their Sovereign, or by their clamorous Petitions for Redreſs of pretended Grievances, and Male-adminiſtration, or by their Election of Factious Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, diſpoſe of the Fate of the Empire, as they did in 1641. by their general Combinations with the then Parliament, which they ſo effectually aſſiſted in their Rebellion.</p>
               <p>It is too manifeſt how little Juſtice the two laſt Kings could have in the great <hi>Metropolis,</hi> the King's Imperial Chamber, or in other Corporations, although they had all, leſs or more, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great Inſtances of their Royal Favours and Graces. And tho' the great City, by the late King of Immortal Memory's Royal Munificence, and Princely Care, as much as in him lay, by Act of Parliament, and his own particular Bounty, (after it was ſo fatally reduced to Aſhes) was raiſed into one entire Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, ſo beautiful and ſplendid, as all People muſt acknowledge it the Eighth Wonder; yet the grateful Returns were unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable.</p>
               <p>This great City enjoyed as ample and beneficial Privileges as any could wiſh for; and though it be deprived of ſome of them, yet, by the Munificence of our late and preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, it enjoys what is needful for its well governing in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Publick.</p>
               <p>Since therefore the Corporations, moſtly, were found to have made ill Returns to their Sovereigns, for all their ſpecial Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; by a moſt wiſe Council it hath been judged fit to enquire by what Warrant they enjoyed thoſe Privileges, and to recall thoſe Charters, that new ones might be granted, moſtly with Additions of Privileges; only that the Magiſtrates (if they ſhould abuſe their Authority) might be diſplaced at the King's Pleaſure: A moſt neceſſary Reſumption of Power, whereby they might not be in a capacity for the future to give any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance to the Government.</p>

Therefore to let her know, that it was to no purpoſe to inſiſt upon any ſuch claim, and that her other Right as next undoubted Heir by blood to the Crown, might be altered or governed, this Act was made: So that we muſt from hence conclude, That it was to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only as one of thoſe Statutes which the Law ſays are made <hi>ad terrorem, &amp; ex terrore</hi> only; which may appear the more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, becauſe it was never made uſe of. For it is to be mainly conſidered, that this Law being made to exclude Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and the Scotiſh Line, as appears by that clauſe wherein it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That every Perſon or Perſons of what degree or Nation ſoever they be, who ſhall during the Queens life, declare or publiſh that they have Right to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſhall be diſinabled to enjoy the Crown in Succeſſion.

Therefore the calling in of King <hi>James,</hi> after this Act, and the acknowledging his Title, do clearly evince, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> knew, they had no

Power to make ſuch an Act; and we may conclude, That ſuch Politick and Temporary proviſions find no approbation, either by the Laws, or ſucceeding ages (who in all ſuch caſes judge more impartially:) therefore it is much more honourable, for the Legiſlative Power, to found their Laws upon Juſtice and Right, rather than upon the humours and Intereſts of thoſe, who deſire but the ſhadow of a Law to countenance their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
               <p>It muſt be owned that King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,<note place="margin">The Injuſtice in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Kings.</note> for making uſe of <hi>Gaveſton</hi> and the <hi>Spencers.</hi> But how il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legally, all ſucceeding ages have acknowledged; and it rather ſhews how extravagant the People, and their Repreſentatives are in their humors, than how juſt their Powers are: For by the ſame parity of Reaſon, the horrid Murther of the bleſſed Martyr, or the Murther of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, may be juſtified as his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing may be; and the like may be ſaid of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, againſt whom the Fourteenth Article was, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to allow the Laws made in Parliament; which had been in effect to conſent, that the two Houſes ſhould have been the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and that he had transferred the Royal Power on them.

               <p>Whereas <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth's time, after he had been declared Heir Apparent, was by another Act of Parliament declared uncapable of Succeſſion; all that can be inferred from it is,<note place="margin">When Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to be leſs eſteemed.</note> That Acts of Parliament (when they are bottomed upon private affections to Parties in times of Faction and civil War) are not to be looked upon with that veneration, as when they regularly paſs, in times that are calm, when no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Perſons oppreſs Juſtice, or uſurping Powers hinder faithful Judges from expounding the Laws ſoundly.

               <p>It is therefore to be conſidered, that in ſuch a juncture of affairs, when the legality of the Kings Marriages were ſo diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, by reaſon that two of the legal Succeſſors (upon niceties not of nature, but of the Popes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Upon ſuch grounds it was very plauſible to declare by Act of Parliament the Succeſſion. But this does not prove that where the Right of nature is clear, that the Parliament may invert the ſame: and they teach us how dangerous it is to leave Parliaments to the Impreſſion of Kings (when it is too obvious, the firſt of theſe Laws was made to gratifie the Kings affection to Queen <hi>Anne</hi>) in the caſe of naming a Succeſſor; as it is alſo to expoſe Kings to the Arbitrarineſs of Parliaments. And we may well infer (<hi>H.</hi> 8. taking ſuch care by his Parliaments to legitimate and illegitimate his Iſſue, according to the preſent intereſts of his Affairs and Paſſions) that ſuch contradictory Acts could not be all true; and though the Reſponſes from <hi>Delphos</hi> or any Oracles of the Gentile ages, might miſs the truth as much, yet by their dubious anſwers, they forfeited not their reputations ſo much.</p>
               <p>We may alſo note<note n="(l)" place="margin">Jus Regium, p. <hi>178, 179.</hi>
                  </note> that by God Almighty's Providence, and the care of his own Laws, the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> was removed by death, to prevent the unjuſt Competitors, and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was born; and by the ſame Providence, and the ſence the Subjects had of the great Fundamental of Hereditary Succeſſion, contrary to ſome of theſe Acts, and what <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth did in ſetling the Crown upon the Lady <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> proved of no force: for Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſucceeded, though ſhe was a Papiſt, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſucceeded her, though ſhe was declared Baſtard. The rights of Blood prevailing over the Formalities of Divorce and the Diſpenſations of the Popes, and the Laws made to gratify <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's pleaſure, as the ſtrength of nature doth often prevail over Poiſons; and to evince the greater certainty of their being void, ſo little notice was taken of thoſe, and the ſubſequent Acts, <hi>Anno</hi> 1535. that the Heirs of the Blood ſucceeded without repealing that Act, as an Act in it ſelf invalid from the beginning: For ſuch Acts are paſt by without being repealed, as we find in the Act of Recognition of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> no notice was taken of the Act of Parliament againſt her; and <hi>Blackwood</hi>

                  </note> of the illegality of them, and of their being contrary to the immutable Laws of God, Nature, and Nations, that none durſt produce that Kings Teſtament, wherein he did nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a Succeſſor conformable to the power granted by thoſe Acts; but that as ſoon as they were freed by his Death, from the violent oppreſſions that had forced them to alter a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor three ſeveral times, and at laſt to ſwear implicitly to whomſoever he ſhould nominate, they proclaimed firſt Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and after her deceaſe Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore all theſe Acts, both of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth,</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Sixth, are to be looked upon as Politick interims, to ſerve for ſome preſent ends. And as we obſerve the trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

               <p>Now there can be no greater fundamental right than the Succeſſion of our Monarch.<note place="margin">The Hereditary Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</note> That our Monarchy is Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is the great Baſis upon which moſt of all the poſitions of the Laws are eſtabliſhed, which every where we meet with in the Writings of Lawyers, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King never dies, the next Succeſſour in Blood is legally King, from the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which the laſt King dies; that there needs neither Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, or Recognition of the People, to intitle him to the exerciſe of his Regal Authority; that his Commiſſions are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, all Men are liable to do him Homage, and hold their rights of him, and his Heirs; he may call Parliaments, diſpoſe of the Lands belonging to the Crown; and all that oppoſe him are Rebells: Generally this Principle runs through all the Veins of our Laws, it is that which gives Life and Authority to our Statutes, but receives none from them, which are undeniable marks and Characters of a Fundamental Right in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such further proviſion hath the Law made, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Succeſſion in the direct line, that if the right Heir of the Blood, or the Father or Mother of the right Heir be attainted of High Treaſon, by Parliament, the Attainder is no

If he, who were to ſucceed had committed Murther, or were declared Traytor formerly to the Crown, for open Rebellion againſt the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; yet upon his coming to the Crown he need not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by Act of Parliament: but his very right of Blood would purge all theſe Imperfections.

               <p>So <hi>Richard Plantaginet</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth his Son, were both attainted; yet <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth was rightful King, and no impediment in the Succeſſion accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh of <hi>France</hi> (though baniſhed by Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Parliament) did afterwards ſucceed to the Crown; and though <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth forfeited for taking up Arms againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, yet he ſucceeded: and <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> and his Deſcendants, being declared Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, by his Brother, King <hi>James</hi> the Fourth; yet his Son <hi>John</hi> being called home upon his Uncles Death, was declared Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Governour, without any remiſſion, or being reſtored; and if his Couſin King <hi>James</hi> had died without Iſſue, he had been declared the true Succeſſour of the Crown.</p>
               <p>We have a memorable Inſtance of this in <hi>H.</hi> 7. who when he came to the Crown, called his Parliament; and the Judges having determined, that thoſe Members of the Houſe, that had been outlawed by the Parliament in <hi>Richard</hi> the Third's time, and been declared Rebels, ſhould abſent themſelves, till a Bill were brought in for their reſtoring: It was moved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Judges what ſhould be done about the King, who had been condemned, and declared Traytor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it was by the unanimous conſent of all the Judges (ſaith the learned<note n="(q)" place="margin">St. Alban's Hiſt H. <hi>7.</hi> p. <hi>29.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, The Conſideration of the Oaths, which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are bound to take and obſerve, gives ſome further Proof of the Obligation of all the Subjects to maintain this lineal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>

Inſtitut. de Jure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali.</note> Law it ſelf confeſſeth, <hi>Naturalia quaedam Jura, quae apud omnes gentes obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantur, divina quadam providentia conſtituta, ſemper firma atque immutabilia permanent:</hi> Certain natural Laws, which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by all Nations) and ſuch is that of <hi>Primogeniture</hi>) by Divine Providence being conſtituted, remain always firm and immutable. So when the Law declares that a ſupreme Prince is free from the obligation of Laws <hi>(ſolutus Legibus</hi>) yet Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers<note n="(x)" place="margin">Voet. de Statutis ſect. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>1,</hi> Accurſius in L. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps F. de Leg. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina paſturalis de re Judicata.</note> ſtill acknowledge, that this does not exclude theſe Supream Powers from being liable to the Laws of God, Nature, and Nations, as is evident by all that treat of that Point.</p>
               <p>Nor can the Law of Nations be overturned by private muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Laws; ſo all Statutes to the prejudice of Ambaſſadors (who are ſecured by the Law of Nations,) are confeſſed by all to be null, and the higheſt Power whatſoever cannot take off the denouncing of a War, before a War can be lawful.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſecondly, a Parliament cannot do more than<note n="(y)" place="margin">Jus Reg. p. <hi>154.</hi>
                  </note> any abſolute Monarch in his own Kingdom; for they, when joyned, are but in place of the ſupreme Power ſitting in Judgment. We muſt not think our Parliaments have an unlimited Power <hi>de jure,</hi> ſo as they may make a forfeiture, or take away Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe, or paſs Sentence againſt the Subjects, without citing or hearing them. For if they had ſuch Power, we ſhould be the greateſt Slaves, and live under the moſt arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment imaginable.</p>
               <p>Therefore an abſolute Prince cannot, in an Hereditary King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (where the Succeſſor is to ſucceed <hi>Jure Regni,</hi>
                  <note n="(z)" place="margin">Nulla clauſula Succeſſori Jus auferri poteſt, modo ſuccedat ille Jure Regni. Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaeus <hi>c. 7. num. 5.</hi>
                  </note> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge the Succeſſors right of Succeſſion; for the ſame right, the preſent King hath to the Poſſeſſion, the next of Blood hath to the Succeſſion. Therefore <hi>Hottoman Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Regno Galliae</hi> affirms, That <hi>ea quae, Jure Regni, primogenito competunt, ne Testamento quidem Patris adimi poſſunt:</hi> That in the abſolute Monarchy of <hi>France,</hi> The Father cannot by his laſt Will deprive the Firſt-born of thoſe things which belong to him by Royal right. So when the King of <hi>France</hi> deſigned to break the Salique Law of Succeſſion, as in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, it was found impracticable by the three States. So when <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> would have preferred his younger Son to the Crown;<note n="(a)" place="margin">Pauſanias, lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Epirots</hi> (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:66310:246"/>
the Law of Nations and then own) refuſed him. So <hi>Anno</hi> 1649. when <hi>Amurat</hi> the Grand Signior left the Empire to <hi>Han</hi> the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> paſſing his Brother <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> the whole Officers of State did unanimouſly cancel the Teſtament, and reſtored <hi>Ibrahim</hi> the true Heir, though no other than a Fool. So if Kings could have inverted their Succeſſion, Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> had preferred his own Third Son to <hi>Lewis</hi> his Eldeſt; and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus</hi> King of <hi>Leon</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> had preferred his Daughter to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Eldeſt Son; and <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth of <hi>England,</hi> had preferred, and did actually prefer the Lady <hi>Jane Grey</hi> to his Siſters <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is undeniable, in the opinion of all Lawyers, That a King cannot in Law alienate his Crown, but that the Deed is void, nor can he in Law conſent to an Act of Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that he ſhould be the laſt King: For if ſuch conſents and Acts<note n="(b)" place="margin">Jus Regium, p. <hi>163.</hi>
                  </note> had been ſufficient to bind Succeſſors, then weak Kings by their own ſimplicity, and gentle Kings by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of their Subjects, or being wrought upon by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of their Wives, or Concubines, or the miſ-repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Favourites, might do great miſchiefs to their People, in raiſing up continual Factions; of the miſeries of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter.</p>
               <p>This is owned in Subjects, That the Honour and Nobility that is beſtowed upon a man and his Heirs, doth ſo neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend upon thoſe Heirs, that the Father or Predeceſſor cannot exclude the Succeſſor, or derogate from his Right, by renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, reſigning, following baſe, or mean Trades, or ſuch like. For,<note place="margin">Fab. Cod. <hi>9.</hi> ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>28.</hi>
                  </note> ſay the Lawyers, ſince he derives his Right from his old Progenitors, and owes it not to his Father, his Fathers Deed ſhould not prejudge him; ſo much more in Kings (the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch violations of Juſtice and Right being infinitely more deſtructive) the Predeceſſor ſhould not do any Act to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice his Succeſſor: For that right of blood which makes the Eldeſt Firſt, makes the other Second; and all the Statutes that acknowledge the preſent Kings Prerogative, acknowledge that they belong to him and his Heirs. For as a Prince cannot, (even <hi>ex plenitudine poteſtatis</hi>) legitimate a Baſtard, in prejudice of former Children, though they have only but an hope of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; much leſs can he baſtardize or diſinherit the Right Heir, who is ſo made by God, and honoured from him with the Character.</p>
               <p>If therefore Kings (how abſolute ſoever) cannot <hi>de jure</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the natural order of Succeſſion, there is no reaſon that the States of Parliament ſhould have ſuch a Power. For by the known Laws they have no Legiſlative Power otherwiſe than by aſſenting to what the King does, and all that their aſſent could do, would be no more than that they, and their Succeſſors ſhould not oppoſe his nomination, becauſe of their conſent: but that can never amount to a Power of transferring.</p>
               <p>For if the States of Parliament had this Power originally in
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:66310:246"/>
themſelves to beſtow, why might they not reſerve it for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo perpetuate the Government in their own hands? So Judge <hi>Jenkin</hi> aſſerts, according to Law, That no King can be named, or in any time made, in this Kingdom,<note n="(d)" place="margin">Liberty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>p.</hi> 25.</note> by the People, Kings being before there were Parliaments: and there is good reaſon; for then the Monarchy ſhould not be Hereditary, but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective: the very Eſſence of Hereditary Monarchy conſiſting in the Right of Succeſſion: whereas if the Parliament can prefer the next ſave one, they may prefer the laſt of all the Line; and the ſame reaſon by which they can chuſe a Succeſſor (which can only be, that they have Power above him) ſhould likewiſe (in the opinion of a very<note n="(e)" place="margin">Jus Regium, p. <hi>167.</hi>
                  </note> learned Perſon) juſtify their depoſing of Kings; as we ſaw in the laſt Age, that ſuch reaſons as of late have been urged, to incapacitate the Children of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt from the hope of Succeſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> Popery and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government, did embolden men to dethrone and murther the Father, who was actual King. For if it were once yielded that the Houſes had a Right in themſelves, to take care for the <hi>Salus populi,</hi> that none but ſuch Princes ſhould ſucceed, who were approved of by the prevailing Faction in their body, nothing but confuſion would follow, one Party having their Votes ſeconded by force one time, and a quite contrary another; yet all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Publick Weal: and ſo a large breach ſhould be made (by pretending to ſtop one dangerous Succeſſor) to the inflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſucceſſive Uſurpers, and thereby the Crown ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ambulatory, but unſtable upon every head that wore it, and alwaies in danger of a bloody ſurpriſe; till at laſt the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia</hi> being ſecured from the expectant Heir, the Factious would find a way to pillage them from the preſent Soveraign, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them into a Mace for an Houſe of Commons.</p>
               <p>I writ this Part with greater Enlargements, in anſwer to the plauſibleſt Arguments for the Bill of Secluſion, while that matter was in the hotteſt agitation. But ſince there will be no need of dilating upon that Subject (now that God Almighty hath ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally determined the Controverſie, by the peaceable ſettlement of his Majeſty upon his Throne) I ſhall cloſe this Chapter, with ſome few remarks of the miſeries have been brought upon King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and eſpecially upon this, by the disjoynting the Succeſſion.</p>
               <p>So we read what dreadful<note n="(f)" place="margin">Jus Regium, p. <hi>166.</hi>

               <p>In <hi>Britain</hi> the whole nation of the <hi>Picts</hi> were extirpated, by the endeavour of that People to hinder <hi>Keneth</hi> Son of <hi>Alpinus,</hi> from poſſeſſing the Kingdom as right Heir of <hi>Ferguſiana,</hi> Siſter of <hi>Mordred</hi> their King. In <hi>England</hi> the Uſurpation of <hi>Harold,</hi> upon the Right of <hi>Edgar,</hi> opened the paſſage to <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror. The Uſurpations of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, upon their Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> and of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> upon the Empreſs <hi>Maud,</hi> were accompanied with great effuſion of Blood: So that a great part of the ancient <hi>Norman</hi> Nobility, (both ſuch as reſided there, or were tranſplanted hither) were ſlain or grievouſly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed. The Uſurpation of King <hi>John,</hi> upon his Nephew <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi> cauſed great diſquiets, during his Reign, and the effects laſted a great while after. The removal of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, occaſioned thoſe laſting Wars, and moſt miſerable devaſtations, betwixt the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster;</hi> during which Uſurpation (before the Crown was ſetled upon <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth) Hiſtorians reckon no leſs than ſeventeen pitched Battels, and eight Kings and Princes of the Blood ſlain, and put to death; and that forty ſix Dukes and Earls, beſides innumerable Barons and Gentlemen, and above 200000. common People were ſlain and deſtroyed, in the ſpace of Sixty Years. To which we may add the cruel death of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth, and his Brother, by their bloody Unckle, and his own miſerable end; and the calamitous fall of the Lady <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> and her Noble Relations.</p>
               <p>All which Princes (although for the ſupporting their unjuſt Claims, Invaſions and Uſurpations of the Crown, they procured Parliamentary concurrence, and popular Eſtabliſhments yet) after ſo great effuſion of blood, could not, in reality, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Right from the next Heir of the blood, but at laſt all centred again in the Right Heir.</p>
